conservation board we're going to begin uh the meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance flag's right over here so please join us recording in progress hey um before we get rolling on the formal agenda here um as you may know I I like to recognize folks who are either in the audience or when we're in a specific Basin and maybe we have a a dignitary so to speak when we were in Crested but back in July um we heard from commissioner Hal there but there was another person that I wanted to recognize then and uh unfortunately he was tied up and that is uh Delta County Commissioner Wendel coun who is also the chairman of the Gunnison Basin Roundtable so I want to just recognize you Wendell and if you'd like to say anything um we'd we'd welcome your comments and um sorry we missed you last summer well thank you I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and appreciate the uh uh the C9 Summit yesterday it was really good connecting with the other roundtables U and all the you folks too it it meant a lot uh I don't think we do that often enough so and I did want to uh uh say congratulations again to Becky Mitchell on her award uh that was quite outstanding Greg you did a nice job introducing all that so and I will be speaking to this board tomorrow also just by chance I didn't realize that um on the miners Trail wsrf application that's a project near and dear to my heart uh connecting the town of hotus and the Delta County Fairgrounds to the North Fork High School and Recreation District out there so look forward to that but thank you thank you wend appreciate it um another thing that I just wanted to touch on before we get rolling is I think it hasn't been totally clear um to the public maybe sometimes how we handle public comment and so I want to clarify that a little bit we typically have often our last agenda item of the meeting is public comment and I want to clarify that that's not structured that way to sort of back burner public comment or kind of potentially make it irrelevant because it happens after we've already done all our business um that's just there as a placeholder for people that want to bring something to our attention that isn't actually on the agenda if you would like to provide public comment on an item that is on our agenda we'd we'd like you to do that at the time that we're hearing that agenda item we do recognize sometimes that or often people have scheduling challenges and it may be hard to sit stand by all day or whatever it takes to to get to that point if that's the case uh you're welcome to reach out to really any of us and and um let us know and we can make arrangements and you can also always reach out to Viola can you raise your hand Viola Viola brish you know she's the one that puts together these meetings and it's probably helpful for her and for us if you do know you want to make public comment to to to let us know in advance so we can sort of note that on our agenda and account for it but uh just wanted to make that clear we certainly don't want to not hear from you about an important item on our agenda at the time that we're deliberating on that item so hopefully that's clear enough um okay our next item here is to review and approve the agenda and I guess I would ask if there's any amendments to the agenda including the consent agenda like let's just deal with this yes director sakata thank you Mr chair I'd request that consent agenda item which consent agenda six yeah uh be removed I'd like to the board to be able to discuss that uh cwcb policy and accept public comment on that have the opportunity for public comment on that and so I think uh you said that we could move that to agenda item item 15 financial matters right so we'll move that to agenda item 15 okay so with that is that a motion to amend and approve the agenda that would be one I motion okay is there a second this is L second okay so we have motion from director sakata second from director Cloud all those in favor of approving the amended agenda say I I hi and oppose okay motion carries um next up is review and approve the 2023 board meeting minutes we have minutes from August 22nd and the special meeting in Steamboat and then uh Item B is our minutes from the regular meeting in Salida in September director sakata Mr chair after consideration for the August 22nd minutes I'd like to uh withdraw my motion on Lauren no I'm just kidding I know really no you know our normal standard practice is approve board approve uh approve uh staff recommendation but in that case it really wasn't a staff recommendation it was really just a a a motion to app Point Lauren riss is our director so I would uh make that amendment to those minutes for the August 22nd U minute meeting minutes that the motion was merely a motion from me to appoint Lauren Miss okay I'd make that motion to make those changes okay there a second all right director comes we have a motion in a second any other discussion on the agenda or on the minutes okay all those in favor of approving the minutes as amended say I I I and opposed motion carries um I guess just to be clear what was there anybody else who wanted to remove anything from the consent agenda fairly short consent agenda okay well consider item three taken care of and we will move on to um just a reminder of our there's upcoming uh meetings for 2024 are listed there any questions on that that okay and then we'll go on to director's reports and as we're heading into that um director Greenberg told me she had some kind of a call this morning she she asked to probably be the last person um and she'll probably be here by then so we'll move her to the end so we'll start with um executive director Gibbs oh yes oh approved I'm sorry I blow it every single month in the first five minutes I swear sorry sorry okay so we have amended our consent agenda but we didn't approve it so is there a motion to approve the consent agenda as amended director sakata I would move to uh approve the amended consent agenda second sorry who second is oh bar okay director Vasquez all right we have a motion in a second all those in favor say I I I okay motion carries sorry about that let's go to director Gibbs great thank you Mr chairman um great to see you all and uh wow yesterday was a great day wasn't it uh with C9 Summit and took a lot of hard work to put that together so really want to give a shout out to Russ cat Elizabeth Jeff baa as as always thank you for setting up this meeting but also working to figure out um C9 Summit um I really enjoyed it um for the time I was there especially um the small group exercise I was in the kind of the Wildfire Forest Health um one and I was originally thinking I'd kind of go to each one but just really the thoughtful comments and everyone was really dialed in and um you know I want to Echo to um Wendell's comments earlier on like hey you know people want to do this more often and they love seeing everyone in person and I I agree I I thought that was just absolutely wonderful and um it was also great to see my boss there um Governor pus who happened to be uh in the same hotel for the national Governor's Association so it just totally worked out so well for him just to walk from one one room to the other and and help uh welcome us as well so um so great conference um uh a few updates for me um first I want to start with Staffing um we have um some some change in Staffing so and some additions as well um Angela bog who's been my assistant director for climate change and um and um Forest Health has moved to be full-time with Parks and Wildlife so she has this brand new position within Parks and Wildlife uh as the climate resiliency policy lead and when you think about Parks and Wildlife and climate change really everything that you all do Rob is is really connected in so many ways so she is going to help connect the dots on um climate resiliency and conservation biodiversity and um and and really um working with everyone at CPW to really uh be a nation national leader um on those subjects so um I will miss her a lot but I know she's still a part of the DNR family but I know she's really excited for this new role and Rob I think you and director Davis will enjoy working with Angel a lot so um also um it was announced I think Becky you mentioned too um yesterday but we have um a new rock star um Michael Elizabeth sakis and if you don't know her yet you you will and um we're really excited to welcome her to the Department of natural resource she comes to us with more than 10 years of experience in journalists um in in Colorado most recently with Colorado Public Radio if you haven't listened to her podcast parched um please do um I was I'm on episode six um and on my way down uh down here this morning and it is just so well done and you just have to listen to the first episode and you'll be like oh my gosh like we made a really great hire so and I know You' already hit the ground running so uh welcome to the family other uh big news and I know um director Ryan will will talk a little bit about it but um uh Kevin is announced his retirement and and he will be done effectively on January 1st and Kevin first um had this job that he's in right now was appointed initially by Governor Hickenlooper in 1998 and so all the division directors within the DNR are a little bit different and how um that person's hired and who who makes the final call and all this stuff and for Kevin's role it's really the governor's call in this and um but Kevin you know um you've been in this role since since I've been in my current role and I really really appreciate working with you and your your Steady Hand with um Colorado's Administration and um with water rights and you know such challenging times to say the least but I've really enjoyed working with you and um really wish you well and and uh hopefully time to go hiking and mountain biking and all the other great stuff that you love to do um once you're officially done but um just really appreciate you and your service and and as Kevin um um you know retires and and you know moves on from the DNR um my plan is to appoint an acting director um right away and and that person will serve um as acting director while we do uh search and um and we really hope to fill that that position as quickly as possible because you all know um Stakes are high with water of course and um and we want to make sure we have uh someone in that role um as quickly as possible other news um uh Jenny Brandon who has been my division director for the division Reclamation mining safety has retired from State service after about 30 years she initially started in the Attorney General's office and uh when I first started she actually played a dual rule as a deputy director of the DNR as well as a head of the drms and really wish uh Jenny well she um you know was uh really my right-hand person like when I first started and and um she's had a you know wealth of experience and um and really wish her well uh in retirement but she's definitely a big loss um for the DNR and uh we have advertised for for that particular um division director role and um we'll start uh that is closed and we'll start interviews here uh shortly to fill that and then another key position within the DNR um you know you've heard me talk about um wildfires don't know that there's difference between federal state private or tribal lands um so the DNR um you know really tries to look at like how we position ourselves on working with a lot of different um um you know focus groups as well as like different you know entities but we have this um position that we've had open for a little while called the federal policy advisor position so every you know Resource Management plan every you know whether it's a Bureau of Land Management or us forest service or Bureau of Reclamation you know we're always weighing in on those um plans hands and so this particular position's um really important helps us navigate you know how we um how we position the DNR um as we communicate with our federal Partners um the budget submitt for uh the DNR has been um uh submitted and want to just highlight um a few items um that that really impact water in particular so the governor's budget included three new division Water Resources River operations coordinators so two folks for the South plat and then one for the Rio Grand Basin um that's really to help provide um higher level oversight and coordination of water Administration across districts um really help with increased workload as well and complexity so uh we were excited to see that um move forward Governor's budget also included one FTE for cdbc CB for the grant section position to support and create new grants um section within the cbcb that would help consolidate and oversight over the water plan grant program and the water supply Reserve fund something that you know Anna Moss has been you know juggling for a long time so that will help I would say um you know free up um um more Focus within that and have a a person that can really dedicate um with that position um other key positions are for um uh staff or state land board that would help um build on land management practices that would improve uh wildlife habitat improve climate resiliency and ensure Watershed Health we have five FTE for Parks and Wildlife staff positions that would be dedicated towards Aquatics management Dam maintenance and Hatchery operations uh nine FTE for CPW to help positions to maintain and enhance Colorado's biodiversity to offset the impacts of increasing human pressure on the environment including staff dedicated for our state wildlife action plan coordination pollinators amphibians Aquatics um species conservation data resource stewardship um and so those are you know really important positions uh to move forward as well and then 34 million to maintain and improve aging infrastructure and facilities at Parks and Wildlife properties including 18.6 million for Dan re Rehabilitation and maintenance 10 million for Hatchery and modernization 2.5 million for state parks development and trails and dayuse capacity expansion um also the fiscal uh 2425 B budget marks return to really kind of the normal uh fiscal restraints within um the state um budget um during the pandemic um the state received quite a lot of federal funds but um we're really kind of back to normal um so when you look at Rec recent High um sance tax revenues um that are subject to Taber which end up crowding out general fund available for expenditures in the state the fiscal 2425 budget included a range of proposals to address these constraints and balances that need for continued investments into water projects and programs um so that resulted in the state's budget by transferring 44.3 million of sance tax revenues that would have otherwise gone through cbcb within the petrol base fund through the Sant tax operational fund spillover mechanism so um this is really just kind of a starting point within the budget um there's still um you know a long way to go in terms of um how everything kind of shakes out but those were um some highlights in terms of um what we see for the DNR and also just um last few years we've we've really seen uh quite a few different new staff FTE so I rattled off um some of these positions that had to do more with water but when you look at the whole DNR budget um we're the governor's proposed 58 new staff positions which is which is really a lot um but really very much needed um also besides the budget um should start wrapping this up but we have our legislative priorities as well um so we're going to have a um our ECMC or NG carbon management commission I think you all know the old um oil and gas Conservation Commission was renamed um to be the energy and and management carbon commission um so it didn't just like rename the agency it wasn't just that but it also included um adding to the portfolio of geothermal underground natural gas storage as well as carbon sequestration um so um there's bills related to you know making sure the language fits with with what our expectations are moving forward for that department uh Parks and Wildlife is also um we're planning on introducing a bill to add to the scope of um of responsibilities to include um invertebrates and rare plants um we also have a title 33 U which is where Parks and Wildlife sits um more or less cleanup bill on that that would look at parks some Wildlife passes and making sure that um we have um um you know um low-income um passes disabled veteran passes um as well as senior passes too for discount so um that'll be moving forward and then we also have a wolverine reintroduction bill that would really enable Parks and Wildlife to work towards reintroduction of wolverines um Wolverines are um have been n native to col Colorado and we we more or less um um you know um in the early 1900s there were more or less like no Wolverines left in the state and um and so we've taken um a lot of effort over the last few years Parks and Wildlife has to to reintroduce a lot of species that have really been on the brink of Extinction and and had have had great success for example blackf footed ferrets uh links several aquatic species as well so Wolverines will be on the next list and um I'm super excited about it um they're high Alpine scavengers which um you know are not as controversial as wolves of course um but um looking forward to that and then um the Water Resource Review Committee um they met last actually on Halloween on October 31st um discussed a variety different bills um including Senator Roberts had a a bill um leaning a bill to ban non-functional Turf um that bill passed out a committee by 8 to2 vote another bill concept that was introduced by Senator Simpson uh to expand and the allowable purpose of powers of Conservancy districts um so we're taking look at all those um next bill of interest um for the DNR is one that requires cdph to study the feasibility of using green infrastructure to sub itute traditional centralized Wastewater and drinking water treatment mechanisms um so there's you know more or less a long list of different you know bills I know Kelly Romero heene has been really covering all these um um bills so if you want to you know get a bit better snapshot of of all that um contact her and thinking of Kelly she's been our lead for the Colorado River drought task force which continues to meet um as you all know that was created by Senate Bill 23- 295 and um they've had meetings you know all throughout the state um of Colorado uh including meetings in ignasio and tawok um to meet with Southern Ute and uh UT Mountain UD as well um tribes and so that's ongoing um you know it's anticipated that there'll be continuing to be a lot more uh challenging topics um as they Whittle down recommendations and vote on that on the December 7th um meeting um that's kind of getting right around the corner so um it's been really busy at the Department of Natural Resources to say the least um I'm planning on being here uh all day today and tomorrow so I'm happy to have any side conversations if you'd like on budget or legislative or uh whatever it may be so with that thanks thanks director Gibbs and and we appreciate you being able to be here two days that's that's great than are there any questions for him director sakata thank you Mr chair Dan um well first thanks to Kelly watching the the drought task force online really appreciate I think she's doing a fabulous job representing DNR there and and so thanks Kelly for all you're doing there um with regards to the budget you know we continually I I know there's a lot of needs around the state but we continually hearing aging infrastructure the need for Aging in infrastructure so this transfer 44.3 million I think you said from s stanks not the first time that's happened to cwcb is that right and is there a chance for us to get some of that back later on um yeah director sakata it's um there there is a chance um it's when uh the budget is introduced it's really the starting point and not the ending point and so um I have scheduled where I have to present uh the budget to the Joint budget committee for example um looking at Lauren riss and Becky and Kelly I think it's on December 7th maybe six or seventh um and so that that really kind of kicks off the process of really like discussing this and then um the JBC will will look at what priorities they have as well and and ideally those priorities align with what the governor submitted but you know as you know there's uh legislators that will say hey I think there needs to be more money for education or more money for water or more money for roads and bridges or as you know there's a lot of um a lot of really important interests and and that's just the start of the process of of um figuring out coalitions and vote counting and and so forth so yeah thank you director GPS yeah any other questions for director Gibbs okay thank you next up we have our cwcb director Lauren riss yeah thank you chairman felt and um thank you all for coming yesterday I think we had a really good turnout at the C9 Summit I was really um grateful to see a number of your faces at the the meeting um and I just want to Echo Dan's thanks to the cwcb staff who sometimes I show up with these things I'm like how did we do this this is amazing um it's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes from arranging panels and prepping questions and getting the room situated in the AV equipment and the slides and on and on and on so it's just a ton of work and um countless hours from Russ and Cad and Jeff and his team and Viola so just a huge thank you to you guys um I thought it it went really well and that's in large part to the effort that you guys put in beforehand so thank you so much um you make us all look good um and I think you know this the substance that came out of that was really worthwhile as well I mean the thing that I kept hearing over and over again was how valuable those types of forums are to have the conversation in person and I think we've all gotten really used to zoom calls and in a lot of ways that's been really convenient we're able to squeeze more into a day but I think um we all just recognize the value and importance of having these inperson gatherings and um you know bringing together these various stakeholder groups and the ibcc and you all to actually sit across the table from each other and um have have good conversations so I hope we can do that again I think we can um we'll take we'll take a bit as staff to sit back back and absorb I think what we heard yesterday and I think a lot of that maybe we can bring back to you and incorporate in some of our operational planning conversations that I'm anticipating are just going to be a standing item agenda item for this board we'll update you on the progress we're making and some suggestions we have and we'll get feedback so I think there were some things that came out of yesterday's conversation that will feed really nicely into some of the operational planning efforts um you know one of those um items that comes to mind that I thought was interesting was you know maybe invite inting the round table chairs to come um and and have a conversation with the board and maybe make that part of our our annual calendar so just a lot of good stuff um uh so I I appreciate all of your involvement um for those of you who sat on a panel or moderated a panel or um sat in work groups or had conversations over lunch just thank you so much um a few Staffing updates um I think you all know that Anam M has been moved into the position of the deputy director and I'm personally so so grateful to have that position filled um Anna's just been a rockstar in the agency for so many years and I can't think of anyone who's um better suited to take on that role so um with moving Anna though that creates um you know that the dominoes uh falling throughout the agency so the next step then was to backfill Anna's position which of course is just a huge role in the agency when it comes to things that go on that are unseen but are really just the driving force and Machinery within the agency so the COO position is just so important for everything we do and is often the unsung hero in the agency so we have been working over the last couple of weeks to advertise for that position um it was posted um Statewide it was an open posting and we had a number of um really qualified applicants but um I think I can announce the drum roll that we that we thank you that we um thank you for the sound effects assist that we um are really excited to announce that Cole Bedford is Gonna Fill the COO position for the agency um is p here so um congratulations Cole it's probably the worst job in state government just kidding it's great you're going to be amazing we're so excited to have you in that position um Cole is also a rockar um and his just you know really taken on so much above and beyond his current position in the finance um section um you see him present loans to you but he's always willing to dig in and um you know work across sections and provide expertise and um I just think has a a really bright future and I'm really excited to see um what he'll do in that position so um that also means that team Finance is hiring so um if you know any if you know any really um Stellar Engineers that want to work with Kirk Russell um tell them to apply we'll we'll be posting that soon and then we also are working on filling some of the positions in the interstate and federal section under am otic um that came out of last budgets um cycle where we got a few new FTE so we've promoted Brian mcferson up into a new position that was created um and then are um have a have someone selected to fill Brian's old position and then are going to be working on um also hiring a federal policy specialist um in that section so we have we are going to have some positions opening um so if you know some um good candidates please tell them to keep their eyes peeled um also just wanted to highlight that you know had a round of retirements that we talked about last board meeting with our budget director leaving Tina hell and um Steve schaw um so we have brought on Sarah Chapa who's just an amazing amazing um staff steel back from the AG's office formally with DNR so she's is she here today she's gonna be here at some point there she is hi Sarah thank you Sarah for standing up yeah she's GNA be already she's been just so helpful um and such a pleasure to work with so we're really lucky to have Sarah um we also have Deb bracie who's our new accountant who is filling Steve scholes old position hi Deb thank you for being here um and then we also have a new uh position in the flood section Karen Meyer is Karen here yay oh my gosh you guys are all here so in our operations accounting budgeting um procurement area of the agency we have a lot of new team members all amazing hires we're so lucky to have them but I think everyone is on the same steep learning curve um so that's that's you know just kind of been a challenge that we're working through and I think it's going to pay dividends in the end when we have some really sharp um New Perspectives on how we do business in cwcb that I think will um you know help us get to a smoother more efficient spot but I just wanted to recognize those folks because they're just hugely important to the work we do in the agency um let's see I also wanted to just say congratulations to Becky who's officially the ibcc director um and that um that little interaction at the end of the C9 Summit yesterday with you and Russ George was like such a tearjerker I think there wasn't a dry ey in the house um just a really beautiful part of yesterday the Highlight so congratulations on new your new role and we're happy to have you back at the table even if it's just for parts of the of the board meeting um we know you're not far away so thanks for everything you do um and then I I also just wanted to quickly recognize that uh Brandy Logan just completed the water leaders program um through water education Colorado we because of the funding we provide we we get one we get one seat in that um curriculum that runs annually and um we always just have a really competitive um process for who gets that seat because it's such a great program and we have so many water leaders in our agency so just just a congrats to Brandy on on finishing that and and we know you have a a bright path ahead of you um one of the things that I've made a priority since starting in this role is trying to sit down with every member of the cwcb staff and just have conversations about um what is working what is not working what we could do better um as far as leadership um and to to just hear ideas and and let let them get to know me a little bit and I have to say that um while speed dating 50 staff members um is a logistical challenge it has been amazing for me um to hear the ideas uh that that people have in our agency you guys know this but our staff is just really phenomenal um I I think to a te everyone that I've talked to is enthusiastic about their job is motivated excited to be here in the agency um and just has a lot of ideas to share so I just want to reassure you all that we have an amazing group of people we've had um some turnover and I I think there's you know a significant number of of the staff now that are sort of newish within the last couple of years but I just am feeling really positive about the direction we're headed mostly in part um because of the people that we have working for us so thank thank you to cwcb staff who have taken the time to talk to me I think um my original intent was for you to get to know me a little bit but it's been more beneficial I think for me to just hear from you about everything going on in your worlds and jobs and how we can um kind of just be a smoother functioning agency um as part of those conversations I've also really been encouraging staff to come to board meetings um so my hope is that you will all will be able to interact with folks in the agency a little bit more this just seems like such a nice Forum that we're all gathered here and an opportunity to hear what's going on in the agency and interact with each other and interact with you so hopefully we'll see um some more faces that you don't typically see in our agency at coming to these board meetings um um so just a couple of of programmatic updates um we've been working on a climate change in Colorado Report with the CSU and we're finalizing that and we provided a uh money to help um fund that report um it's really a crucial climate report with with some downscale data for Colorado that we're aiming to release in January so coming soon um this was also an action uh in the water plan action 4.8 so we're continuing to just check those boxes on um the things that we've committed to doing in the water plan wanted to let you know that um we're changing The Branding a little bit of the water availability task force we have so many task forces out there and that sort of indicates that it's a um a thing that comes up once and then completes its work and is done and we know that that's really a standing um committee and and you know we want to recognize the value that that provides so we're rebranding it as the water conditions monitoring committee um hoping to to convey the ongoing nature of that um the next uh meeting of that group will be November 28th um if you haven't tuned in to listen to those they're really valuable um especially as we're approaching the ski season and um just kind of hearing what the long-term water forecasts are and hearing from utilities around the state so super valuable if you haven't tuned in I'd encourage you to do that um Grant uh Dan mentioned the kind of the budget um impacts um from the governor's budget submitt just want to emphasize that um that cwcb has requested as part of that budget one new section chief that would be in charge of a new section in the agency that would solely manage grants all of that has currently been housed in the operations section which just creates a huge um section to manage so our hope is that that just creates some organizational efficiency nobody's jobs are going to change um that currently work on water plan grants or wsrf but um our hope is that they'll just be better supported if that budget item goes through so um fingers crossed that we kind of make it through the JBC and general assembly process but um I think that would be just a really valuable um organizational change for the agency um I also wanted to mention that uh we have as part of the written director's report some details on the arpa grants that were awarded from the federal technical assistance program that we run um we received $2 and A5 million doar for local capacity grants as part of HB 22379 and we've currently awarded 1.3 so if there are project needs in your Basin that you think could benefit from some additional capacity support please direct them to us um we still have some funding available there and um we just continue to hear how valuable that capacity support can be for projects so don't forget that's out there and if you need a reminder of what it is and how to apply um reach out to our staff um we have Michael Reagan who's working on that Anna also is a tremendous resource um wanted to mention kind of an upcoming event in January where we're going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our instream flow program which is just amazing um 50 years so more details to come on that but um just kind of wanted to put that on your radar um it's such a huge milestone um so so we'll we'll have a some kind of celebration around that that we'll make sure you're all invited to um we have more Colorado River issues on the agenda but I did just want to highlight that our system conservation pilot program applications are open so you can check on the ucc's website for more information and to see the applications it's not our program I sort of misspoke there but it's it is being um run through the ucrc but applications are up um anyone who wants to apply um needs to start meeting with Wilson water group to discuss your project um you can also discuss or sorry you can also check the commission commissioner's corner on our website for Colorado specific information and updates um two two more quick items that I I didn't want to go without mentioning um I think we all are aware that Barbara bigs passed away on October 5th due to some complications with cancer um and you know she I think we all recognize was just a household name in the Colorado water Community um most recently she worked as the general manager of Roxboro water and sanitation and was the um Metro Basin Round Table Chair um and just has played just a huge role um in Colorado water policy and conversations in Colorado for a long time she was the chair of the cwcb board in 2005 and was on the water quality control commission for many years I personally met barbs about 10 years ago um kind of when we were starting to do the engineering for the Chatfield relocation project when she worked for HDR and she was just such a force in navigating um working with the Army Corps of Engineers and um all of the complications that that were and continue to be in some days Chatfield she was just a just a Guiding Light um for me personally as I started to figure out what was going on in Chatfield and she just continued to be a mentor to me I think as a a female um with a leadership position in the water Community um so I think we're all really grateful for her and uh we'll miss her um in our daily interactions on these important topics so just wanted to recognize Barbara um and then also lastly to thank um director Ryan for his years of service as the state engineer um and Kevin I think I've known you for a long time as well and various capacities as we both sort of navigated our careers in state government and have always looked up to you with your I think even keeled um you know very pragmatic logical approach in conveying sometimes controversial and heated um topics especially in in front of legislators on a microphone I think you um inspire all of us to do um just the good the good work with an even temper and a level head so thank you so much um we're GNA miss you wish you the best of luck on your mountain bike I have an Instagram account now that I know to follow we can maybe put that up on the slide later um Kevin's gonna be an influencer um in his retirement days already he already is up there with Kim Kardashian thank you so much Kevin um we appreciate your role on this board and in all things um yeah and water so thank you so much that is absolutely right so I think that's all I have thank you all so much happy to take questions thank you director is are there any questions for her yes director sakata thank you Mr chair um director R I appreciate your comment about reflecting about having potential uh round table chairs here I really want to take notice though our our current chair what a great job job he does of whever basin we're in I think he really reaches out to try to invite somebody you know and that could be a basin chair as well so I think that's a nice procedure maybe we could include a possible um option AB to include um also included in your report was about the urban landscape task force um so I I'll leave it up to you guys but if there's ways that we can get that that information out once the report is written whether it's at a presentation to us I know our January meetings packed because we're combined with um uh water quality control commission but I don't know maybe water Congress is going to be doing a presentation on it as well so yeah no that's a good that's a good highlight that I didn't mention they've had five meetings now um and I think are working on wrapping up a final report and once that comes out there'll be some Fanfare around that and I think we'll take advantage of a variety of different opportunities to present that and get the word out yeah they've been working hard thank you um question for you you mentioned this instream flow celebration will that be in conjunction with our January meeting I think that's the plan I'm kind of looking at Rob in the background he's going to be our party planner for that so okay yeah good any other questions all right let's go to ibcc director Mitchell okay yeah um I just wanted to um um you know just reflect that I appreciate that the governor appointed me to this ibcc role a few years ago I remember making a few calls um like Andy and and others in the water kind of leadership Community around the state and and saying you know hey I'm going to be um this new role and a lot of folks are like you're going to do what um and but I had I really enjoyed um serving in that role and working with local communities because it really felt like being a county commissioner again in many ways just the the localized approach um and I couldn't be more excited to have Becky to be in this this new role we have had conversations I want to say you know for at least a year if not more about her taking over um this leadership role and boy has she already done that really her and her team have I think already connected with eight of the nine maybe uh roundt so far around the state so I'm really excited to have uh Becky in this role now to really take it to um amazing level and when you look at the the BPS around the state and hearing from roundtables you know everyone has an interest and what's going on on Colorado River issues doesn't matter where you're at in the state so to have Becky to be in this role to be informed by roundtables as she's making critical decisions on the state of Colorado I think it's just just amazing NE Nexus and so um really happy Becky so turn over to Becky um thanks and I'm going to try to keep it brief since we haven't even had an ibcc meeting since this um this new role um I I'm excited to be the new chair of the ibcc and continue to lead these important discussions on intrastate issues um around the state I I yesterday was an important reflection on the import um the round table and the ibccs influence as as these local groups whose knowledge and expertise really help ensure locally driven collaborative Solutions on water and and that that's what Colorado is and so I'm hoping to build on that um especially now as we Face these challenges um not only in the state but across all the western states um we all know that that Colorado River issues have have dominated the headlines over the last um couple years and many ibcc and roundt uh round ibcc members and roundtables are talking about these issues I think everybody is uh the general public is um and and I I what I'm hoping with this role is that even more than ever that the the stakeholders across the state um have felt they've had a direct line of communication with me but we'll have even more so now uh I'm I'm committed to continue and update the committee on um on Colorado River issues and and keep those lines of communication open I'm also uh committed to following Robert sakata or having him drive me around the state or be on the virtual uh uh uh Zoom with him uh and and really get to um all the local roundtables I happen to be going to Gunnison on Monday and so um just trying to live with that connection and make sure that we're taking those the that input um to every table that we're at so um you know when we talk about the Colorado River issues it's important to also Rec recognize that Colorado water is so much more than just that and and not everything that we deal with um every day or in every Basin is about the Colorado River um even some things um that are related to Colorado River Solutions like water conservation are things that we can focus on and and we can really set goals um not only as individuals or individual communities but as as a state and so I'm I'm eager to have the ibcc focus on um the full to focus on the full State and and help think about no regret um I I'm reflecting on old ibcc work of no and low regret strategies that that really can help us across all the sectors um under any future and and really focus on advancing the Colorado water plan so um lastly I I know that ibcc has struggled with what it means to be an ibcc member and what that leadership means and and I hope that we can wrestle with that together um a bit and have some shared understanding of the kind of collaboration and work that ibcc can lean in on um I'm I'm working closely with the cwcb staff to plan and nail down those next ibcc meeting um dates for for 2024 um I fortunately had the opportunity to speak at the the C9 Summit hosted by the cwcb so thank you um again for that I don't think people recognize the quality of a conference that they are getting um you you pay hundreds of dollars or sometimes thousands of dollars to go to a conference like that of that caliber and quality that that cwcb puts on and and people can attend everyone can can be there and hear this and and I think um opening that up and and is is an important piece of what our our jobs are as water leaders across the state so um I'm I'm committed to reaching out to every ibcc member in in the coming months to really discuss their hopes um for the committee and and where we can think outside the box but also where we can Inspire collaborative solutions to our water challenges and and that's that's my goal so um just laying some Foundation there uh I don't want to Bel labor too much because we H I haven't had any um ibcc members or meetings as director but I do want to um acknowledge Kevin Ryan and his time and um and not only his time at the state but his friendship uh you may not all know that I think we were apped the same day um and um in role as former cwcb director and then State engineer and um we were friends before that but that brought a level of closeness and it interestingly enough happened to be right at the end of um a gubernatorial um term which is not the easiest time to take on a a new role and it's not the most secure time to take on a new role um and not the smartest time um to to take on a role like that and so I I appreciated um there was only one person that got um got that and that was Kevin and so we've we've gone through a lot of that together and we got to stick around which was huge and we got to stick around together so so um it's it's not the end of of our friendship for sure and if you want to follow Kevin I think you just hashtag melanzana Grandpa okay yeah um and and there you go and and maybe they'll put out like a retro melanzana for for everyone so we could all follow in Kevin Le but more interestingly enough um I bring that up in just but but true if you go and look on the the Instagram it's it's Kevin around the state at water features and and I think that encapsulates who we are as water leaders like you you really enjoy water and and the structures and and uh it's not just a part of our work life it's a part of who we are and I think that's that's something that'll oh I will appreciate from not only you Kevin but everybody sitting at this table water is who who we are and and is so much more than just our 9 to5 or 7 to seven depending on the day so thank you thank you Becky are there any questions for her director sakata thank you Mr chair first uh director Gibbs thank you uh it's amazing to me how many plates you're trying to balance all the time and you know that that that leadership on the ibcc during that time period I think it really allowed a lot of people better get to know you and understand all your roles and everything so thanks for that and all your leadership and Becky I'm going to put you on the spot right away sorry um there was one thing that came up yesterday from the C9 Summit that I thought was really important is that um also to really focus in on pepo I I not I'm not really sure I was going to ask Russ later about this but really since pepo was formed under the water for the 21st century act whether that's a role also that you guys want to take on because it seems like pepo also they they want to have more structure of how to work together I mean I heard yesterday they kind of want to have a pepo C9 Summit where they're focusing together you know I think u Lisa darling and Ken brener are really focused in on that I think can really take it a long way so I would ask you to to in your travels and in your work with the IBC and with cwcb some Focus could be brought to that because I think there's real potential there as well thank you and I I uh definitely appreciate that that comment it it is something that we're focused on across the state and the work that you all do um is incredibly important but the education and Outreach associated with that is is important so we have that support and so thank you for that input we'll be um keeping focus on that and I'm sure as we travel around together Robert that um you'll continue to remind me thank you any other questions or director Mitchell okay we're going to skip over uh director Greenberg for now and go to state engineer Kevin Ry thank you Mr chair and thank you everyone my goodness I'm seven weeks away from retirement which is a ways out and I'm already feeling those pangs of uh regret so to speak at losing this privilege I'm in and some of your comments really point to that U but thank you Mr chair and I want to start thank you director Gibbs for your comments and for your leadership that I've seen for the last four plus years four and a half years U i' I've so appreciated your leadership and I'm just always in awe at the work you do and how you're in several places at once it's just a a great example for all of us of that passion we have for natural resources in Colorado and then I want to move on to director riss and thank you for your comment yes I've just really enjoyed the connection we've had over the years very special one um I think you know as well as I do when you said I was pragmatic and logical that was music to my ears and that's not a tongue and- cheek statement I think that those two can be at odds at times and trying to find that balance between pragmatic and logical I think is is the challenge we all have every day so thank you for the all your comments but especially with that and then I I want to say thank you to Becky too many words uh that I more than I can articulate right now but I'm going to refer to something you said in a few minutes because uh it was Eerie the way you read the notes I don't have for my talk today but this is my last director's report and I thought it'd be a nice thing if I recognized all of you and the work you do uh but I've kind of done that in an email mail and so and I will continue to do that but instead I'm just going to talk about me for a few minutes and you'll have to indulge me because what are you gonna do not invite me back to the next meeting so so here we go logical and pragmatic I I'd like to talk about my retirement and and speaking pragmatic there's a good reason for this because I announced my retirement I arrived at it I thought for good reason and then I've had the questions you know why are you doing this what's up why would you retire and I had think maybe I should have consulted with more people and thought about this some more but but I went back and I I thought about it and that's what I'd like to uh talk to you about just real quickly the basis for my retirement and I'm going to do that with a a series of scientific graphs and photographic evidence today uh to convince you and convince myself and I I want to start I want to start that by telling you that wh did I do that I'd like to do that with just like I said a nice scientific graph and if you look on a scale of one to 10 my passion for water Administration over the years since I started with dwr it's been right up there to 10 and I hope you've seen that passion for me over time and I can even say that if you look at the trajectory I I would see that continue on so why retire when when the science is there and well you know there is an explanation to that and to do that explanation I need to go back in time about 45 years 46 years and tell you a little story and I'm going to try not to meander too much but I I think I have a point that's relevant to all of us and relevant to my retirement but if you look back to the time I was a senior in high school and the day that my dad came home home from work and said you know my company's got this little essay contest and you can enter it and you can win a scholarship to Outward Bound and my response to that was pretty much like my response to any suggestion from an adult at that time I said Okay that was pretty much it and uh a few months later in July after I graduated from high school I found myself in the gor Wilderness for about a month on an Outward Bound Expedition and for those of you that have heard or read about Outward Bound you know some of those iconic stories are true that's the way that Alpine Expedition went but what I'd like to do is is just really um first of all photographic evidence that I actually was uh in the gors on the summit of Mount pal in 1977 so there's a a Ry 17-year-old Ryan on Mount pal and I just want to point out that sweat is still available at many of your back Country Outfitters if you'd like to look that up on Amazon but not to digress I I seriously came away from Outward Bound with two two Impressions one of them was water Believe It or Not For Those you all backpack Fish Camp everything and we we seek out water we our trails are along the creeks and streams we camp by the river we camp by the lake our kids want to play in the water and throw rocks in the lake so there's some sort of connection with water some sort of inherent conect I I would call it a visceral connection with water you know we have the cliches water is life most precious resource and we also have the work we do for water but there's also the the fundamental base to that is our inherent connection visceral connection to water and so I I really established that in myself and the other thing I did in that month in the gore Wilderness uh being a high school two or three day backpack trip guy suddenly I was away from vehicles and structures and and beer and cigarettes and all those things that are important to a 17y old for a month and it established in me this new found draw to The Back Country especially the Alpine back country in Colorado and you all know what I'm talking about at some point or another you're drawn to the back it's it's not just a good idea or you think it'd be fun but you're somehow drawn to it and you don't want to come back you delay coming back and that was a very real new feeling that I got and uh I just want to pause give you a little bonus picture when we're on this Outward Bound Expedition several groups overseen by this this mountain goat of a man that was bigger than life to me at the time and and I managed to capture a picture of him in 1977 as well and that man was Randy Udall Brad udall's brother we all know and love Brad uh sadly Randy passed away coincident not so coincidentally maybe backpacking in Wyoming as I recall very sad but but there he was um 46 years ago in my experience uh so so that's your bonus picture But continuing on with that I I just want want to again talk about how that was beneficial in two ways the water and that new Found Love and the the importance of that new Found Love is that it positioned me very well a few years later when I met this girl named Robin who had that same sort of draw to the back country and that same sort of reticence to come back and wanting to stay there and so our Our dating and engagement took place on 14,000 foot Peaks and wilderness areas the Wucci the Holy Cross Gore Flatt tops cross country ski trails uh we we even uh spent a week backpacking across the Grand Canyon and just by the way a few minutes ago I realized that I was posting a picture of myself my shirtless self and I leaned over to Becky I said is that all right I think she said whether they you to do not invite you back but but it's 38 years ago so it's a different person um but you know that that was our life and I just want to say that U you know the rest of the story from there we got married kids careers mortgages suddenly that that love that urgency to be in the back country and all those things took a backseat to these more practical concerns to make that point back to the graph now we have another curve on there this urgency for family time back Country Water personal interest it was there and it was at a high level but it was at a nine where the my passion for water Administration is at a 10 and so it didn't get neglected but it took a back seat the last leg of my story and I'll wrap it up here is that we were all in Crested mute last July for our cwcb meeting and this is very real what happened I was driving home and um drove past that Meadow that high mountain Meadow with that Meandering stream and I felt that tug again in a way that I hadn't felt in quite a while and that tug was you really needed to be up here and not rushed not rushed to get home and so the curve did that and it just jumped ahead and now has this trajectory and that uh you know that explains that desire that need for me to retire right now it's just a matter of graphical evidence and and to emphasize that or punctuate that is just um you know this this is part of what I I need to be able to spend more of my time on so the lesson then to bring this full circle and make my point a little bit relevant to what we do here um do this continue to do this work that you all bring your intellect and energy to do on behalf of the water users in Colorado it's so important ReDiscover or reestablish or reaffirm build on that visceral connection that we all have with water um Becky like I said I think you were reading my mind uh because it's not in my notes but this idea of how we're connected to water how we seek it out how it's so important to us at some level other than that practical level so keep doing that that um but then my other advice since I always leave is some water Administration advice maximize beneficial use and don't cause injury and your honor that is what I have to put into evidence today I rest my case than you thanks I think what I would say now is May your green line remain at 11 are there any other comments or questions for director Ryan well yes director Brown what's the first Adventure January I retire on January 1 I have jury duty on January 2nd and and beyond that I have no plans have they moved the jury duty to a 14er say that again get them to move the jury duty to a 14er there's a plan okay any other comments or questions yes director Bret director Ryan I just wanted to take the moment that you know being able to work with you um in a actual setting with water stuff over the period of time and the levelheaded approach you've taken for our state um remain with great gratitude for you thank you very much thank you director appreciate anyone else yes director Greenberg uh director Ryan thank you for that wonderful and heartfelt presentation um I in addition to what director bruche mentioned I just want to say thank you for your willingness to show up um I first met you when I was with young Farmers Coalition and asked you to come to monuma county for a water law 101 Water Administration 101 and uh I think we had a packed room um down there in Cortez or Manus and and um you made that Journey just in order to help sort of share the knowledge of the role of State engineer with a lot of beginning farmers and ranchers who are maybe getting their feet wet so to speak in how water law and administration work in the state so just appreciate your willingness to show up and and always help share the message of the role that you've served in thank you thank you yes director coms um director and I just wanted to say thank you I I appreciate apprciate the science behind your decisions we always have but I want to thank you for your kindness in your Humanity in a job that can be so sterile and so black and white I don't think you have ever let that be your guiding principles and um being on the other side of water administration at times being the water rights holders and everything I want to tell you how much I appreciate just the humanity and the just the Integrity you've brought to it and I will always be grateful for that for the job that you did there so thank you very very heart FY than anything else all right well we will be uh vicariously uh enjoying your retirement and uh we'll see you out there let's um director Greenberg would you like to go now or I kind of had you at the end but is that all right okay um let's just let's go to parks wildli then director Harris great uh thank you chairman felt uh and uh director Davis send his regrets uh the Parks and Wildlife Commission is meeting in Burlington over the next couple days so he is probably somewhere between here and there right now on the I70 um so yeah I also want to Echo uh cpws and my personal congratulations to director Ryan thank you uh for uh just an incredible career of service and and uh yeah I I thought Lauren said it well when I was thinking about you know your leadership and just that calm Demeter and always solution oriented approach you bring to everything it's just been a real pleasure working with you and wish you all the best with that grandson so um and and uh I'll also just quickly yeah Echo the thanks to uh to Jenny Brandon best wishes on her retirement and just to thank you to Bar bigs too yeah um very hard to top that last presentation uh there are are still some very exciting things uh going on uh that CPW is privileged to be a part of um so first of all I I think thanks to executive director Gibbs for giving that update on hiring Angela BG for the new climate resiliency policy uh position very exciting position great individual professional to be in that position so um I think that's really going to grow our ceiling as an agency having her in that role so very excited about that um also uh we hired a new water project mitigation coordinator um this person will be folks probably mostly know Carlin Armstrong uh who uh handles our state uh mitigation plans and she's getting some much needed help from Patrick Patrick comes to us from water quality control division we've had a great relationship with him over the years and just been very impressed with his work and um so it's great to see him join our team uh and and enter this new role where he's is going to be focusing on projects on the Western Slope primarily there's no strict dividing line but that's generally where we see deploying him so um let's see I have a significant update on uh the Highline Lake uh adult zebra muscle treatment UPS update um I think many of you probably saw in the media that the efforts that we had in the spring uh to eradicate those muscles uh were not completely successful uh we found additional larel and adult muscles uh in the reservoir um and uh this infestation We Believe continues to present a significant risk to the Colorado River uh Downstream of Highline Lake uh and to other Aquatic resources in the state so we're going to be taking uh we CPW will be taking additional significant action to address uh this infestation um in October we applied another round of the EPA registered mesco side Earth Tech z um and the goal of this application is to reduce the amount of muscles that are present in the reservoir it's the same product but we're using at a higher concentration still less than half of what the label allows um and the timing we think might be a bit better because the temperatures in the reservoir were warmer and that seems to be uh more cond conductive to achieving the desired mortality um during this time no water will be released from highin Lake into mwash uh until it's been determined it's safe to do so uh we're restricting the fish Harvest um and Advising against canine use of the reservoir um and removing as many dead fish as possible to reduce scavenger consumption and and having uh unintentional um impacts to non-target organisms um so once the copper levels have fallen below the Aquatic Life standards will be releasing water from Highland Lake to draw the reservoir down completely um and this draw down will be M throughout maintained throughout 2024 um as a result motorized boating will not be happening at Highline in 2024 um and uh so we we hope to to maintain that completely dry level as as our our most aggressive frankly approach to to uh take care of these muscles permanently during the winter of 20124 25 and then we'll be uh continuing to monitor for at least five years beyond that and a huge huge thank you to the broad CPW team we've had to move quickly these are tough issues uh to to wrestle with uh particularly when you're dealing with um a molesco side like this um and chemical treatment um and uh we we've just got a fantastic team uh dedicated to to solving this problem uh for our park and for the state as a whole so um and now I get to move on to um some more fun updates um let's see and one of which I think I mentioned this last time is the mount Shavano uh lwh head Dam here is the dam as it uh stood um this is the used to be the main diversion point for our mount Shavano Hatchery just north of Salida and you can see there's the the main diversion structure and a white water um uh shot I guess you might call it to the right there and uh here we are starting to remove it uh and uh see can see the equipment going in there and first taking out the Whitewater uh structure and here's after they've rerouted the entire Arkansas River through that structure and now here's the the lwh head Dam that's dried up and now you can see the heavy equipment coming in and removing the dam and no more Dam and here's the Arkansas River uh flowing again and they're still doing some finish up work but but the dam is history uh and you know folks I think we've mentioned before you know what a risk that dam was to uh boers on the river and uh so it's it's a relief to have that thing out and I just want to extend a huge thanks to chaffy County uh director felt uh the natural resource damages trustees um and the incredible CPW staff the Southeast region our Capital group group uh who really you know did all the heavy lifting uh to make this possible um so that's that's a moment for celebration and if that weren't enough uh we also have uh some pretty exciting news about uh the Colorado River connectivity Channel um for folks probably familiar this is the Windy Gap uh reservoir uh this Reservoir was really close to the well you can see the Frasier in the Colorado River we coming in just above it there and uh it's part of uh northern's windy capap uh project um the reservoir was built in the early 80s and uh unfortunately since its construction it's prevented fish passage and sediment passage and is really harmed the um Aquatic Life uh Downstream of the reservoir and um you know sort of concurrent with uh the uh or or proposal and construction of the Windy Gap firming project the stakehold ERS in that you know really saw an opportunity to address uh this situation so some highlights of the the solution here which is a channel to bypass the reservoir and reconnect the Colorado River is one mile of uh new stream which will be open to public access for fishing uh a stream channel designed to pass both fish and siment uh 50 acres of newly activated flood plane and riparian habitat over 10 acres of new Wetland habitat and uh this is the pro product of over 30 years of work from great Partners including Northern Waters Municipal subdistrict Grand County the Upper Colorado um River Alliance trout unlimited and CPW plus we've got great project supporters including this board uh the Colorado River District um we've got USDA nrcs uh whole bunch of other folks that you can see down there below um who've contributed uh in in many different um to this project um the Project's coming close or costing close to $33 million and northern northern water is leading the construction uh Tu really took the lead on obtaining funding with half of this funding coming through the usda's nrcs $6 million from this board and the rest spread between uh Northern corporate sponsors Grand County the River District um and private donations um and as of uh about a year ago so it's going to be the real number would be higher now but CPW has contributed about 12,200 staff time hours to this project or at least to the headwaters project of which the connectivity is a part so uh the project started Construction in 2022 and is expected to be complete about this time next year um and though construction's not done uh really elated to announce that uh that the water has flowed through the CR CC for the first time this River channel on October 25th um and so at this point all the Colorado River Flows at this location of the river are going through the connectivity Channel and uh on that first day it ran for about 140 150 CFS and took about two hours to make through the the channel so as a part of this uh project uh you know CPW is cond conducting a fish movement study and you can see these fish passage arrays on the right hand picture um and thanks to the effort of CPW staff these arrays are currently collecting data Around the Clock in fact um CPW downloaded the first set of data and is excited to report that we found fish making it through the channel on the very first day of the Project's operation which is very cool uh so we in total 16 fish uh we counted in the channel um and uh and and these were all rainbow and brown trout and we'll be studying the channel for about the next two years and here's another uh picture of of these arrays where we can count the fish and a very uncomfortable looking fish getting tagged there and let's see if we can this might take a second yeah there should be a video on that slide yeah if we could run it a video of the connectivity Channel seeing water uh for the first time well while we're waiting for the video to load I just want to thank uh Northern for leading the construction and for being willing to share uh these photos uh or these images on the crcc with you all today um and uh all the project proponents I think would really welcome uh the opportunity to come back uh with a final presentation once this is done um and uh we could potentially also uh share the video from Carlin Armstrong who I believe is online if uh that would help yeah let's do that if if we can let U Carlin share her screen yeah here it comes that is concludes the director's report for CPW and yeah I'd be happy to entertain any questions if there are any yeah questions for director Harris director Bret yeah thanks so much Rob um I think that this room in people know you know how important this project is but a reminder you know I think lene drug meets in my first meeting with this in 2004 um two of its primary Champions associated with it are are no longer you know with us to see its completion um but the amount of organizations and effort uh in connection of what this was for a West slope East slope project in our state such a nice reminder of you know when we partner and get along the great things that we can and I think that you know even commissioner Mitchell for some of your talking points this is some of the great work that Colorado does to work together and find ways to make systems work so thanks Rob great thank you director director sakata director Harris I Echo what Paul said even before his time when I sat on the Water Quality Control Commission uh it was a big issue and to see how much time and energy has gone in this and the collaboration so I would suggest instead of us receiving a report that we have the opportunity to go up there and tour so I would suggest the next time cwcb has a board meeting up there that we plan a tour of the site yeah and so um one question though on Highline Lake um I think Highline Canal has a pump did they have a pump station up and back into that will that affect their their operations next year if you're going to keep the lake dry I I I think the short answer is yes I can get more detailed information you about how how exactly that's going to work out um but I do know that that is a concern for I I I think the Grand Valley folks right yeah as long as you're in communication with them I think that's the main thing so they know in advance yeah thank you director Caris thank you other questions I guess I have a question uh on the on the uh connectivity channel are you are you monitoring uh the Aquatic entomology as well so I believe the answer to that question is yes because I mean really one of our Target purposes for for uh wanting this project as CPW is to see that macro invertebrate Pro population that that's sustained this worldclass trout fishery and still does but but but has been significantly hampered by uh the original Windy Gap Reservoir um to see that bounce back to much closer to the way it was so I think I can safely say the answer is yes although I'd have to talk to John yart and and our aquatic biologists in the area there to tell you exactly what we're doing okay yep director Bret so it was about um five years ago um different efforts of uh bug counts and studies that CPW is doing and then some that learning by doing were doing they they merged all of them so I think in total don't quote me but I think it's uh 17 riffles above Windy Gap on the Frasier River and also up the headwaters of the Colorado and then down all the way to gor canion are all tied to the ongoing study to understand and monitor what happens long term with not only bugs but also with fish okay okay because it just this is probably a stretched analogy but like it's it's pretty easy to figure out what the fish are doing in my experience but the Aquatic entomology it's sort of like groundwater you know you're like well I got this indication and that indication but I'm not I can't really see it all um and it seems like a really unique opportunity to go from nothing uh and watch how different orders of insects how quickly they repopulate and kind of and that will affect the fishery too I mean those 16 fish are going to be really hungry um so it's a it seems like a just a great opportunity to learn more about how repopulation happens you bet and I'm getting a uh ping from from Carlin here that uh that we are in fact you know including that bug monitoring as part of the Adaptive Management program and and really with the the way this channel is designed is to move sediment I mean it's part of the whole point point of it and that's that's what we really need to have a healthy bug population in there great director Vasquez I also think this is a marvelous example why we shouldn't put any new reservoirs on stream right so as we look at proposals for more storage which came up yesterday in time and time again that the importance of storage the what kind of storage is really important other comments questions all right thanks director Harris um I was looking on my participants list on zoom and worried that uh couldn't find director director mcclaflin but I see he's in the house so uh let's hear from the Water Resource and power Development Authority thank you Mr chair first of all I want to thank the board for hosting um this meeting in my home City so I could participate at very much appreciated that may have not been the reason but I'm happy to be here in person um I'd like to Echo some of the other thoughts and and congratulations to folks including uh director Ryan uh he's somebody that I've admired for a long time um when he speaks if you normally when he's given a presentation you look over at me and I'm feverishly writing notes and taking pictures and I know I'm a better water leader and I just thank him for his education and and thought fulness and and you will be missed um also want to congratulate Anna and Cole I've worked with Anna for uh a lot of years she might say more years than she would like but I have appreciated her time um she's so thoughtful in her job and and works just relentlessly and so I want to congratulate her as well moving on to my director's report uh at the authorities October board meeting we had three drinking water programs that we approved one was for the North Washington Street water and sanitation district one to buyers water and sanitation D district one to the town of Starkville the dollar amounts and project descriptions are in my report if you're interested um we've closed four loans under our bill program again that's the iig funds the huge 500 plus million dollars that that we began to receive in 2020 22 um and those funds are continuing for five years and and we're making some good progress ress there four loans on the drinking water program for about $100 million um that split approximately 5050 between Grant funds and Loan dollars our loan capacity for 2024 is about 110 to 120 million including the bill funds um and we just received two additional pots of funds and emerging contaminants which the focuses on posos and then we've also received uh additional funds under the lead service line program and although there's a huge amount of Demand on our programs um the emerging contaminant pot and the lead service line pot are really lower um in terms of demand than the other pots and I think it's in part because there's still a lot of work being done to determine the inventories in the state and those of that are familiar with the lead and copper rule there's a lot of work being done so those inventories are being made but if there are projects out there particularly you know posos P projects um or LED service lines please reach out we're looking for those projects we've only had um one application approved and executed under the lead service line a handful more in the pipeline and we have no uh project submitted yet under merging contaminants in a couple years worth the grants now I'm expecting one large merging contaminant Grant coming in from South Adams and early next year um and that funding is 100% principal forgiveness or Grant funds so um big opportunity there and I know when you look around the state um there's going to be plenty of opportunities to apply those funds once folks do some some work both on the inventory and Discovery side on the Wastewater side uh we had no application submitted in October we've closed six loans under the bill or iiga funding for about 10.6 million if you recall drinking water was 100 million clean water or waste water we're only at 10 million that's because of the discrepancy and where the funds um are focused and and with the i J or Bill funds the the predominantly all the money or Mo the vast majority of money is on the drinking water side so that's why you see that uh disparity of numbers there on the Wastewater side we're seeing huge demand across the program um and and folks aren't making that distinction on where the funding is really coming on drinking water so on the Wastewater side we only have about 25 to 35 million left and I think we will actually see enough applications in January will will be out of funds um that's the first time this program is has ever ran out of funds on the clean water side um and in part that's because of you know I think our staff has done a tremendous job of of pushing the funds and and making everyone aware of the opportunities to come in for those projects you know traditional infrastructure projects is um primarily where those funds are going um but we've also seen some Cuts as I've mentioned in the past and we've built out the pipeline based on sort of the robust funding we were getting and then we were seeing some some fairly substantial cuts so far the cuts under our base program have been about1 19 to20 million across both programs which really means about a 30 even $40 million cut as those funds aren't being lent out and they're not revolving over time um so that's having an impact on our program and and in a large part why I think we will be running out of money here um in in January uh we're spending a lot of time on this issue as you can imagine I just came back from uh back-to-back conferences is sort of late last night I was at the NW talking to sort of my counterparts over there trying to build support for full funding for the srf programs um also worked with my counterparts at other states at CA uh that was in Oklahoma City Council of infrastructure financing authorities was essentially represent it's an association that represents the srfs around the country um and and we're pushing for for full funding the uh of the srf programs but I think the Congressional directed spending which is really a car vout you know we're being fully funded at the top line but then through the appropriation process they're being cuts and about half of our base program funds have been cut for those congressionally directed spending I I don't think those funds are going away um I I I think they're very popular with Congress and so we're working with Congress the Senator's office um we've been working very closely with they've been great to work with on this issue unfortunately I don't sit on the Appropriations Committee who are making these decisions um but we're working with other States who do have appropriation members and and thankfully our Senators have also reached out to appropriation members and staff you know stressing their concern about the long-term impacts that the cuts will have to the state revolving fund program I think grants feel good um and and they're needed um but it's a we look at the infrastructure in this country and in the state and the demand is always going to outstrip the supply of funds and when you're granting sort of all projects um your really short funding projects into the future right I mean we're just not going to have the funding to to meet the infrastructure needs five years out 10 years out and 20 years out like the srf programs are designed to so last thing I want to mention was a retreat we've got coming up in uh late November early December with our board the congressionally directed spending is is a big focus of that we're also going to be talking about interest rates we're likely increasing interest rates which which is always a difficult decision ision it's much easier to decrease rates people like that much better than increasing rates but we're really kind of behind the curve uh and need to increase the rates um we're going to be making some hard decisions about our capacity given the cuts to the program do we limit the size of funding um per project you know to some smaller amount and the principal forgiveness um or Grant dollars potentially to just disadvantage communities um giving the cuts to the programs um last thing I was going to mention our continued work on the ABC or Arkansas Valley cont it your staff has been uh continue to be great to work with we've been working with um Matt and Kirk on this project and working very close I spent a lot of time with South Eastern last week at NW talking about funding for that project incredible project you know that was a project that um when I first started and that was 25 plus years ago under the programs people said that project would never be built you know and to be there in person and see that project being built and to be a part of it is is something pretty amazing so I will stop there and I'd be happy to answer any questions want to thank you all for your time great questions for director mlin director sakata thank you Mr chair thank you director mclin for being here we appreciate it and thanks for these updates it's very valuable for at least for me to have a better understanding about about those shortfalls and trying to do everything I can on my end and I it's it's been good too because I I personally sent a letter to the drought task force you know because there's a lot talks about increasing our grant potentials here that how important the revolving Loan Fund programs are and like you said it's more for the future to look toward the future so because of the awareness that you brought about your program really alerted me to that issue so thank you so much for taking the time to do that that's very much appreciated director sakata thank you and I would just add um Keith thank you for your work on the Arkansas Valley conduit and thanks to I think director Brody and brown and Anderson uh and others who were on this board before the rest of us and director Mitchell Who provided this state leadership that on a federal program that actually I think really turned that sort of uh fantasy into reality and um just appreciate your involvement in that too thank you thank you anything else okay thanks thanks let's go to director Greenberg and thank you uh chairman felt for rearranging the order uh to accommodate me this morning I do have a brief slideshow um and as we're getting that pulled up um for starters just want to say congratulations to um cwcb staff for a great C9 Summit yesterday I was glad to be able to attend and I'm grateful for all the uh Round Table members ibcc members who traveled a long distance to get to Westminster and um just appreciate all the conversations yesterday um we have uh I have a legislative and budget update for you all which I will run through here in a second and I'm conscious of the time so there it's a big package it's actually an historic package that we have for our budget proposal this year so I don't want to do it and Injustice but I don't want to do your um our break and Injustice either um but just quick operational updates from CDA we have a lot of moving pieces um in a lot of hiring processes right now so I've mentioned we have an EG water adviser we are in the process of going through interviews for that position so I very much look forward to our next meeting hopefully being able to um introduce you to that person and again that's the first time CDA has ever had somebody full-time who will be dedicated to water um we are also hiring for two really key division director positions our head of marketing retired Tom leety um earlier this fall so we're in the final stages of hiring for that role that job that position overseas so many new programs that we're building all of our egg Workforce Development our paid apprenticeships our nextg leadership scholarships food access um Market orders uh anything to do with the economy in agriculture has really landed in that shop as well as our Loan program um speaking of loans so um looking forward to to finding that person here soon and our brand commissioner Chris Whit who has been with the department for about 12 years is retiring at the end of the year so we are in the process of working on finding a new brand commissioner um along with the brand board um coming up over the winter we're going to be posting for our two climate marketing positions so if anybody out there is or knows a great marketer who wants to help connect the work we're doing on climate with new and emerging markets for Colorado producers we're going to have two people doing that full-time both here at in the US domestically and in internationally um and then you'll recall last year or I guess earlier this year I created um four new positions Regional assistant commissioner positions that are built for working farmers and ranchers so that they can keep farming and ranching but be on my senior team so we have two right now who have served for a better part of nine months Joe steno up in Northwest Colorado uh as well as George Whitten down in Swatch and they've just been fantastic out in the field doing what they do but representing CDA and representing their communities with us I'll be posting for the remaining two RAC positions this winter we'll probably leave those postings open for a good while since it's farmers and ranchers we sometimes we accelerate our grant programs on a timeline that doesn't work for uh working farmers and ranchers when we have the flexibility we want to leave a little bit more on ramp for folks to consider and take advantage of the offseason or the conference season which we're entering now for egg uh for folks to consider that so more to come soon but wanted that to be on your radar now I want to jump in um to to the slideshow and might need a little help on the clicker the there we go okay um I'll do a quick again CDA budget overview this is a this is our whole agency just very rough scope budget breakdown basically just to show you a couple of things one we have been and will continue to be predominantly cash funded at CDA so almost two-thirds of our budget comes from our cash funds and that's the day-to-day work we do uh with our regulatory programs our inspection programs um so many of our staff are integral to the food system moving for example if we don't do our phyto phytosanitary inspections on potatoes we can't export potatoes out of the San Louis Valley so this is thanks to the industry paying in to make sure our programs and our staff are running uh smoothly um you'll see we're just about 28% General funded uh and the rest is federal and reappropriated funds the the item to note which we'll go into the next slide is in bold there that our total requested funds for this next cycle is a 20% increase over our current budget so we are looking to be at uh just around 81 million um for this next cycle so what this is to say and you'll see with the total FTE we're increasing as well um this is my and my team's goal to right siiz CDA for the challenges we have before us what we're asking for in the scope of the state budget is very very modest but what we're asking for in the scope of cda's history and investment in our people and in our communities is historic as I mentioned so this is I have two budget slides we have 11 budget items and I think that number six got cut off a bit but I'll just walk through them real quick but I the concept that I hope you see from our package is that we're thinking a we spent a lot of time in the field so what are we hearing and how do we filter that into our budget request B how do we ATT tackle very near-term challenges and the long-term challenges and build off thirdly what we've been building these last four or five years in terms of the infrastructure of CDA so you'll see here this is sort of Flesh on the bones that has that impacts every of our nine divisions within the organization to really flesh out what we've been building the foundation of so our first one a Emergency Management uh program this is to build off of um a successful request we had uh just a couple years ago to bring on our first full-time a mergency coordinator we want to flush this out with having FTE folks in the field three people across the state who will help our egg communities plan mitigate respond to and then recover from uh disasters of all kinds uh when we talk to the state um you know the head of the homeland security here in the state Emergency Operations Center they remind us that CDA is activated on pretty much every emergent event in the state so this will be capacity for our Rural and local communities to be part of that uh response number two division of Animal Welfare you all know Animal Health and Welfare are strategic objectives of ours this is Administrative reorganization where we'll bring our two Animal Welfare programs under one umbrella be able to hire a division director as well as administrative support and to again Regional field folks who can help on the Outreach and education those two sort of being our strategic efforts around Animal Welfare this is not a request for change in statutory Authority but a realignment what this will also do will allow our state veterinarian Dr Maggie Baldwin to be freed up to focus on building our emergency response program and tackling foreign animal disease which is her primary and key responsibility um number three is investing in our a drought and climate resilience office so almost a million dollars for renewable energy adaptation and development as well as other sort of resilience projects that we are building under the adro drought and climate resilience office um so that'll be money again out to Farmers and ranchers to help with renewable energy transition in a way that supports productive agriculture the next uh three items are more internal so number four operational increases we have a few programs that we think are really critical that are not cash funded um and don't have a solid uh sort of Revenue stream so we're asking for dollars for our conserv Colorado State conservation board cscb which supports all 74 conserv districts in the state so again we want to keep resourcing the districts that are so integral to administering our star soil health program and other programs um we're also asking for money for our markets team both on the Colorado proud uh marketing which is really our consumer facing branding for for Colorado egg and for our International work um and then R5 and R six are really focused on you know cash fund spending Authority increases so we can basically help improve our operations our staff support and our our capacity and then our indirect cost assessment so we can make sure we're taking advantage of federal money indirect money to help pay for our overhead to run all these programs so last slide on budget um our seventh request is to support our nextg leadership programs um we've been we created a NextGen scholarship program last year so this is a request to put more money there and to put more money into our paid apprenticeship program our egg Workforce Development program so that's for young people to get field-based experience on farms or ranches we pay them and we help cover the overhead for the producer number eight investment in rural mental and Behavioral Health grant program this would be one-time funding to continue our work on Rural mental health but then we would sort of graduate that program into one of the newest agencies in the state the behavioral health authority but with that Keen focus on Rural and a mental health and we've developed a really phenomenal partner network of folks in EG and in rural communities um doing this work on the ground so that's kind of going to be our model moving forward you'll see a theme here in terms of our model which is how can CDA bring in resources reduce barriers and then move those resources out to the field where the most trusted relationships tend to be so same with Workforce Services number nine this is really related to the labor challenges we're seeing in EG right now we've got new labor laws in the state um that are really starting to hit the road right now and producers are starting to feel um there's new uh just trouble accessing labor overall and so our proposal here would be again to bring in Regional based folks to help our both our egg employers and workers navigate the new regulatory um sort of state of existence here in Colorado but also find resources make sure they know their rights they have access to those Services they may not have um had experience with before so really that technical assistance in the field uh number 10 we've got some uh Tech needs that we need in our system so it's you know it's not fancy but it's going to help us modernize and I should say that all of this what we're building is really for me making sure that CDA is a relevant 21st century agency both on the day-to-day work that we have to do making sure our team is taken care of but that we're also able to support the a community in places that we know are um squeezing us right now um the last one is a hemp Center of Excellence this came up a few years ago um it's being revived now it's actually we're asking for dollars from the marijuana tax Cash Fund which has a limited scope of use but one of the uses is for hemp research so we're not we're not trying to outbalance hemp over other Commodities or product areas but there is this opportunity with that cash fund in particular we want to take advantage of um so that's budget the next uh controlled maintenance you guys probably don't care about that but just so State Fair folks know we are continuing to invest in the State Fair Ground so this is what this one's about um we have 100 acres and historic property down there which requires a lot of TLC more than the state is willing typically to invest in so we are constantly pushing for um for getting more dollars to the ground sound there and then legislative proposals and I'm nearing the end this is almost my last slide because I want to just do a brief update at the end on my international travel um we've got six bills that we're intending to run next year of course there'll be dozens more that impact egg and the things that we work on that will be responding to um but these are what we're really going to be pushing forward so the top three are tax credits we are very focused on using that tool this year just kind of given our budget situation but also I think tax credits in Colorado are really important lever for advancing the work we're doing so number one sustainable ad tax credit again these are these are just headlines we are going to be fleshing these out over the coming months and of course through ledge session but how can we add another tool to the toolbox for folks who are doing stewardship work and taking that work to the next level so kind of tying in a tax credit credit with our star grant program is one idea um so a lot a lot of questions there but really excited about where we're going to take that the second one the NextGen a lease tax credit we right now have a a a beginning farmer tax deduction on the books for those who lease land to beginning Farmers you can receive a tax deduction for that lease Revenue it's not working we haven't had I don't we don't know of a single person who's enrolled in that so our our thesis is that if we make it into a tax credit and bump up the cap it's going to be more feasible for folks to actually do this and we're actually talking to Farmers Union about kind of expansion around um is this just lease could it be sale what kind of land access tool can this be but it's really a tool for succession and helping beginning Farmers gain greater access to land while helping you know families think figure out what their succession plan is um equine welfare Li insure and grant program this would be for public facing uh ewine facilities uh to to basically work with us through a lure program to ensure high standards of Animal Welfare not saying we don't have them right now we just don't know and this is part of again getting ahead of uh the curve on Animal Welfare um really focus on prevention education uh we think that something in this realm again that we're working through with stakeholders and legislators uh might get us to a a next level of of standard of care um here in Colorado um number five um I'm personally excited about gender neutral statute Updates this has nothing to do specifically with agriculture except when you read title 35 um it it references he him for the commissioner for the state veterinarian and for many other roles so um for those of us who do not identify with such pronouns we are constantly translating our own statute so we figured it would be time to just take pronouns out and reference job titles knowing that these jobs are now um taken with folks of all stripes so and then the last one is a pretty simple extension of our Authority around the Wild Horse project which we are overseeing um in partnership with a lot of folks including BLM we just can't spend the money in time so we'll need a little bit more so that is my um pre brief run through on what you're going to see for us from us for session next year again incredibly excited and I skimm the surface so if anybody has questions followup ideas please find me um while our budget is pretty well baked our l proposals are not whatsoever and that's where they should be right now is really a place of being open to to what the best idea is okay so lastly I just want to wrap up with a couple of slides on international travel um since I saw you last I've been to Chile and to London on two different missions um so this is our uh trade mission to Chile to Santiago and down on the lower right you'll see that's our our delegation at the Port of alpar ISO on the coast um the the woman on the left is uh us USDA under secretary for trade Alexis Taylor who is actually a former a commissioner of Oregon uh and just a phenomenal advocate for American agriculture so we uh while it was a USDA Leed trade Mission we had about a couple dozen exporters us companies um and then four states represented by Commissioners or deputies who went to represent American agriculture as a whole on this Mission we were also celebrating 200 years of diplomatic relationships with Chile and 20 years of trade with Chile um it's a really remarkable time I think from a Colorado perspective couple of my takeaways One chilite Imports all of their livestock feed and we are obviously a big producer of feed and so that was interesting to me um they're also their consumer base is growing in such a way that they want more value added consumer facing products and they're interested in us products um beer wine spirits is another big growth area so all of these are places where Colorado excels and could expand our business there also really interesting being in the southern hemisphere thinking about their export strategy as in they grow sort of Mediterranean crops in the offseason for the Northern Hemisphere so um a lot of good thoughts there um so that was really impactful just I think from seeing what USDA does how States fit in and how we're all kind of promoting us a together um and then the the next uh mission was to London um as part of a strategic partnership that Governor polus announced that back in May between Colorado and the United Kingdom um so we took a delegation you might recognize some faces there took a delegation over in October um to kind of start really getting Flesh on bones for what that partnership is going to look like um so you'll see we had uh representative um Ken McCormack our chair of house EG representative Mark Catlin our vice chair of house egg with us on the delegation Jordan Beasley my Deputy was sort of head of mission along with my team John and Ashley are intern National marketing team um we had Farm Bureau leadership James Henderson from the valley and Ashley House their policy director and CSU leadership as well with CJ mucklo um from up in route County as well as Jordan craft Lambert who's with CSU spur Innovation um you'll see some uh selfies of us outside of Big Ben and doing business in uh some very very old buildings in London um and we also uh spent a lot of time on the tube ourselves around the city which was pretty fun but so anyways next steps on this we are now um we're working with OED at our office of Economic Development and trade to push forward the Strategic partnership especially for egg other Industries as well but really focus on research on climate on Innovation and Entrepreneurship and how we help expand business within that realm between their country and our state um so that was it I think my last slide this is very random but I got home and this is a picture of our office in Broomfield field that one of my staff took um I was just thinking like man I've been been traveling a lot like what's a grounding thing and this was pretty cool to come back to and just you know we're in a Suburban development in Broomfield but we're still pretty wild in some senses so um anyhow Mr chair I probably didn't help you at all on time but I appreciate you entertaining my uh my report thank you director Greenberg that was a great report um any questions director Basquez quick question on your higher r three uh does this include promotion of Agra voltaics yes thank you so um on Agra voltaic yes that almost a million in the investment Renewables will continue our investment in Agra voltaic we also have half a million dollar onetime spending that the legislature gave us for aggra Vol take research and we will be announcing I'm not sure when we'll announce but I believe the the Review Committee has chosen those research projects so we'll have some more to report on that in the months ahead that's great to try and uh improve the acceptability to the a community and the the the County Commissioners around them another question on the Wild Horse I didn't know that CDA was involved in that having been on the BLM resource advisory Council for Northwest Colorado for a number of years that whole BLM Wild Horse and burrow issue is always quite hot and wondering what cda's role is there um it's a great question um we were not necessarily expecting to get this uh work because it's not something historically CDA has been involved in but we're we're pleased to have it now we've we're so essentially we oversee this new program The Wild Horse project which is focused on a number of things one facilitating a working group which we've had two two-day meetings um already this fall which are all public meetings um the second of which is to look at fertility treatment on the Range so our our task force our working group is made up of probably a lot of the folks youve I mean BLM is we are hand and glove we can't do anything on the Range without them so that's um that's our Baseline but then working with a lot of the friends groups who have done darting for a long long time um folks who are much more embedded in the work then we have been our guiding us through this task force about what our next steps will be and then we do have resources to put into fertility treatment and then looking at the sort of what happens after adoption you know sort of protocols pipelines Etc so um happy to follow up on more details as well any other questions yes director Coles so I definitely have a connection dag and I appreciate you I think the the words you said you're making CDA right sized and I still think your budget's too small if you're going to make it right sized for Colorado but I do appreciate what you're doing with the new programs and the tax credits for the transitioning of Family Farms um as you get the Aging average of the American or especially Colorado Farmers I think that's very timely to keep a viable and keep those multigenerational Farms so applaud you for looking at that to see how you can make that program actually function rather than just shelf it and say yeah we got something for that so thank you any other questions or comments director sakata thank you Mr chair so what have you been doing commissioner wow amazing that's incredible thanks so much for everything you do I would piggyback on what our um director Colmes has mentioned about that program is um really investigate the opportunity for water leasing as well include that in tax on not just water not just land but maybe water as well so thank you yes attorney general Weiser just want to say how lucky we are to have you as commissioner um tremendous agenda and work um that is robust I particularly give you a shout out on the rural mental health uh Focus which is a real need I'll I'll mention that in my marks as well so thank you for all your great service anything else okay well I was going to say attorney general it's nice to have you at the table again great and um it's 11:03 I'm uh going to try to ring the cow bell at 11:15 so we got about 12 minutes here for a morning break recording stopped e here so if folks could uh get in their seats we'll get going uh our next item item five is shonne power plant water rights background information with Rob V hi thank you rob V cwcb staff uh this is an informational item there will be no board request for Action today um unfortunately the sales scri between Excel and the River District has not been completed yet um but we thought this would be a great opportunity to provide some back background information on the Shon and water rights some of the large agreements that take place in the Colorado River and administration in the Upper Colorado so today for this uh agenda item we're gonna have first Assistant Attorney General Jen mey provide a high level overview of those four major agreements that influence the Chon water rights and the operations of those water rights after which we'll have Caleb Foy who's the lead assistant engineer in Water Division 5 uh provide a presentation on the main mainstem Colorado River uh Administration and then finally we'll have Peter Fleming from the River District provide an update on the timeline for the completion of that purchase agreement with Excel Energy so with that I could kick it off to General mey thank you r uh again this is Jen mey with the AG's office so um I'm going to provide just a very brief um discussion I guess of these four agreements this is sort of a rare opportunity for me to talk about Colorado River things so that's exciting um these Agreements are much more complicated than of course you had summaries in your board packets they are complicated they are detailed these are very highlevel summaries to um give I guess a basic understanding of uh the agreements that are in play on the colado river as Rob said that could or be affected by the lack of shon call um please understand um I you know I didn't work on drafting these agreements I don't operate under them and um so this is just my take on the Four Corners so anybody who knows better can feel free to correct me on on how these things work or how they're drafted but um I'm G to start almost in chronological order um I'm G to start with a Shon call um the agreement regarding the reduction ofy call agreement this is I think commonly referred to as the 2007 relaxation agreement date of this agreement is um 2006 it does have a termination date um in 2032 so it's 25 year agreement there are nine years left um my understanding is that this agreement started out in 2002 which was a dry year of course um Denver Water and Excel reached an agreement that year to um relax that that EXL would relax their call to allow Denver Water to divert additional water into their reservoirs so they could divert their additional West slope water rights um for their use and then the two parties agreed to make it a more of a long-term agreement after that first year so um under the terms of this agreement when there's a projection and of course there's detail on how the projection works and what a water shortage is but when there's a projection for a water shortage in a year it allows for Denver Water to divert more water to store more water um the uh Public Service Company would reduce their call to a one turban call 704 CFS this would only occur in the march to May time period um and then one provision of this agreement is that um if the call from shason is too low to avoid the Cameo call then they'll adjust or increase the Shon call so as to keep the Cameo call off next up we have the Colorado River Cooperative agreement that is a 2012 or 2011 2012 agreement um in the summary um board members you had just article six of that agreement it is a much larger agreement there are seven articles it's a 51 page agreement um my understanding on this agreement is that it was triggered by the NEPA process C for the enlargement of Gross Reservoir by Denver Water now the Blue River decrees come into play as a part of this um issue I believe the parties went to mediation to resolve it and the crca is the result of that mediation there is no termination date on this I believe this agreement runs in perpetuity um key to our discussion on the Shon rights is this article six which is about the Shon call and you can see in the summary the stated goal of this agreement which is permanent management of the Colorado River so that the flows of the Colorado River mimic um flows that occur in the event of the Shon call whether or not that plant remains operational so under this agreement in the event um of a of an outage at the power plant the power plant isn't functioning the River District um Middle Park and Denver Water agreed to operate their systems at as if that call was in place as if that call was on the river um this only goes to shon's senior right though you can see that 1250 um that's the extent of it in the irrigation season in the winter or the non-irrigation season um the mimic call is only goes up to 900 CFS there are exceptions um this isn't going to come into play in very dry seasons and of course the agreement goes into detail about what that means but they are based on projections again and so under this agreement it is Denver Water and the River District agreeing to adjust their operations um sorry they adjust their operations um to their systems on a on a permanent basis under this outage protocol even if the power plant ceases operations alog together and regardless of whether someone buys the power plant and the water rights um does seem like they're expressing a desire to make sure that call or um you that call stays in place and is in operation even if the power plant is not as a part of this agreement the parties agreed to try to negotiate um with the Bureau of Reclamation um to get the bureau to agree to operate Green Mountain Reservoir as if the Shon call was in place and one aspect of this um crca article 6 was an agreement as to um administration of green Mountain Reservoir that's difficult without Bureau on board um and um so it it was articulated in that agreement that they wanted to try to do that and um I believe that is how the actual shop the Shon outage protocol came into play because that agreement is um very similar to article six of the crca but brings additional players in um I think importantly Bureau of Reclamation but also another of other participants there you can see uh Northern Grand Valley water water users Association Orchard Mesa Irrigation District and the Grand Valley irrigation company they are also involved in this what is called the shop agreement so same thing as article six of the crca under this agreement the parties expressed their desire to keep the flow regime of the Colorado River as it has been historically influenced um by the Shon call but only by the senior right for the Shon call under this agreement Reclamation can terminate for just cause this agreement does not apply if the um 2007 relaxation agreement is in operation same thing as article six it only um goes up to 1250 CFS in the um irrigation season non- irrigation season uh the calls mimic up to 900 CFS there are are same sort of exceptions for water shortages each of the parties were subject to the outage protocol they have a different set of conditions that apply in order um to accept them out of this agreement dwr does administer this agreement um and so when the power plant is out then dwr looks to this outage protocol as if a um and administers the river as if the senior call were in place for the Shon um Power Plant it is important to note that this shop agreement um is temporary it's a 40-year term that expires in 2056 um I believe that even when this expires we do still have the crca article six that is a permanent agreement so we the shop or I guess when the shop expires if it's not extended then the article six would kick in but but um as I said it does look a little different than um the shop in terms of who the players are and who is restricted by this I I believe I heard somewhere that you know re Reclamation is a main player in this shop I'm not sure if there's an ability by all the players in this agreement to extend it um that might be a good question but in the event of an hour outage of the power plant dwr both look to this shop agreement for administration then the fourth agreement and I saved this for last I think um maybe unintentionally but because I'm less familiar and I've heard less about this agreement that's not to say it's any less important but it is older than the three I just mentioned it is dated from um dated 1996 and it is the result of a um water court case that was a seemingly minor um application for an exchange and I guess an a good example of how these Water Court cases can blow up like you never expect that they're going to but it did become what what is a um I would call I don't know if the parties would call a global settlement and it is a detailed stipulation and agreement in that water court case um the effects of that agreement are to um limit diversions by certain parties down near the um roller Dam um in certain situations and in certain times for example the United States is prohibited from calling in certain situations you know in a time frame and reduces The Cameo call which I think can normally be 2260 CFS they're only allowed to call up to 1950 during a certain time this agreement has an element of protecting H users um and then that that pool in Green Mountain Reservoir and that is definitely something that we'll have to check in with Caleb on when he's going to be be able to speak that more than I can in his portion of the presentation um but it is also my understanding that if the shason call is not in place then the limits provided for under this check case are no longer in play so this agreement is very dependent on the shason call so that call goes away these limitations that are set um are no longer in play I believe there is a longer and deeper Cameo call in that and um affects things um like bringing on Lower flows in the main stem I think and and um fewer protections less water less flows I guess in the 15 Mile reach so all things we'll want to hear from Kaleb on so I think this is a good time to transition to Caleb Foy thank you good morning everyone can you hear me okay yep sounds good Caleb thanks Greg I appreciate it um thanks for having me uh this morning my name is Caleb Foy I'm the lead assistant division engineer for Water Division 5 um who's charged with administering Waters um tributary and including the Colorado River within Colorado I've been asked to present this morning on a couple um a couple things regarding main stem Colorado River Administration as well as um provide some some insight to potential implications of there not being a call um at the shonne power plant or or not operating the Shon outage protocol as as Jen just referenced um Thanks Jen for setting the stage on some of those um agreements in the Orchard Mesa check case that'll help make my job a little bit easier as we as we go through this presentation here all right so my presentation outline um what I'm going to be presenting on today again I will it's difficult to really discuss potential implications of no call or no shop operations at the shonne power plant if you don't truly understand some of the fundamental concepts of administration within division five so I'm planning to talk about some of the key drivers of that main stem Colorado River Administration um as well as speak to those potential implications of not having a call or shop operations at sh sh um the major components I'll speak to are the large Trans Mountain Reser diversions the large reservoirs um the major calling Water Rats on the main stem as well as the Upper Colorado River endangered fish recovery program um so just starting off um the key drivers within uh Water Division five are the large Trans Mountain versions which are identified on this nicely handdrawn map in red um the large reservoirs which which are identified by by some of the triangles on the various tributaries of the main stem Colorado River um the calling water rights one being again the one of Interest the shonne power plant here located in Glenwood Canyon and then what we collectively refer to as the Cameo call which are um mainly irrigation water rights associated with uh large canals that um provide water to the Grand Valley at the lower end of the Colorado River um just Upstream of the Utah border and then lastly is this 15 Mile reach um associated with the Upper Colorado River endangered fish recovery program which extends from the tail race of the Orchard Mesa um Power Plant to the Confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers um so again just focusing on these large Trans Mountain diversions um a primary driver of administration within division five this is just a map produced by the Office of the State engineer showing all Trans Mountain diversions across the state um and basically um as you can see a number of those are originated in in Water Division 5 in the Colorado River Basin um as far as what we see in division five there's 17 Trans Mountain diversions over the last 30 years the average annual diversions have neared um approximately a half a million acre feet with just over 360,000 acre feet um being exported to the South Plat River Basin and just over 135,000 going to the Arkansas River BAS I quickly want to go through kind of some of the major ones I think the important thing to note um as we kind of work around division five and identify some of these large Trans Mountain diversions is both their location um and whether they're above or below shonne meaning would would they be subject to a call at shonne and as well as their priority and whether they would be called out um by one of the shonne water rights um so first is the atams tunnel this is associated with export of water um pursuant to the Colorado Big Thompson and Windy Gap projects um this is above located above shonne um in the headwaters of the Colorado River um and it has a priority that's called out by the Shon senior water right next we have Robert's Tunnel located um in the uh Blue River Basin this is also located above shason and is called out by the shason Jr um it roughly approximates uh nearly 50 4,000 acre feet per year of export moving over to the Moffet tunnel um again back over to the headquarters of the Colorado um being the Frasier in this case this is the above shonne and called out by the shonne senior the mafit approximately um exports roughly 43,000 acre feet per year um moving on to homestake roughly 22,000 acre feet per year again above shonne and called out by the shonne Jr um the boad tunnel this is associated with exports related to the frying pan Arkansas project roughly 50,000 acre feet per year um this is actually below shonne um uh up the frying pan River um and it's called out by Cameo Jr call qu Lakes tunnel just over 37,000 acre feet per year roughly again located Bon and called out by a cameo junr call next I'd like to dive into um kind of the the large res reservoirs and take a similar um just cruise through the Basin to identify those uh large reservoirs where they're located in relation to shonne and their relative priority um I think the first thing to point out for these large reservoirs within Water Division 5 is that they're often involved with one of several components they're either used as storage on the west slope um for water that's used prior to being released through a tunnel for diversion to the East slope um they might also be used as an augmentation Supply to allow those Trans Mountain diversions to occur um even at times there's a senior Downstream call on the Colorado River um as well as the final piece um they they're often used as compensatory storage for West lope water users associated with these um Trans Mountain diversion projects um so the first one I wanted to point out was the Colorado those associated with the Colorado Bing Thompson project um there's four main reservoirs Grand Lake Shadow Mountain Lake Grand B Willow Creek um The Windy Gap is also a part of this as part of the Windy Gap project um roughly 445 acre feet the asteris there is that it actually has been reduced as a result of the Colorado River connectivity Channel which Rob discussed earlier this morning um moving on to the headwaters of the blue Dylan Reservoir just over um nearly 260,000 acre feet of storage located above shonne and called out by shonne Jr call Green Mountain Reservoir um just over nearly 155,000 acre feet located above shonne and called out by a shonne senior call now one thing and I'm glad Jen kind of pointed this out um I wanted to take a minute to just speak to Green Mountain Reservoir and kind of a little bit of its background as well as its important and this will be important to um to remember as we discuss the potential implications of there not being a Shon call um so Green Mountain reservoir uh was authorized as a part of the Colorado Big Thompson project authorized by Senate document ad0 um and it kind of is composed of these two pools first is the 52,000 acre foot pool and that's really to replace um diversions out of priority diversions associated with the CBT project taking water to the East slope um the other pool um is this 100,000 acre foot power pool um or what's referred to as the power pool and this provides um compensatory storage to generate power and benefits West slope water users the 1984 Green Mountain operating policy kind of further Quantified the perfected uses of the reservoir and really provided a means for disposition of the remaining water of that 100,000 acre power pool um most important or maybe not most importantly but important to recognize is of that 100,000 acre foot power pool um there was 66,000 acre feet dedicated to what's uh known or referred to as the historic users pool and basically um you know this historic users pool was meant to benefit West slope water users in that it allows those West slope water users to continue to divert for their irrigation and domestic uses that were perfected on or before October 15 1977 so basically what this what this pool allows is or releases from the pool allow those qualifying water rights to continue to divert even though there might be a senior call on the main stem Colorado River at either shonne or Cameo um again this is an important concept um for both westlo water users um but also for what we refer to as hup Surplus water which will be discussed later on in the presentation um another aspect of the operating policy was there was 5,000 acre feet dedicated to the silt project and another 20,000 um to contract for all uses um including those post 1977 uses and Industrial uses that are not included in um what's provided by the historic users pool and Green Mountain Reservoir so I know that's a lot of background on Green Mountain Reservoir but I do think it's important to kind of lay the foundation for it um especially as we we discussed the further implications of of no call it shonne um just finishing out the large reservoirs through the Basin where we have the Williams Fork reservoir uh just over 95,000 acre feet located above shonne and called out by the shason senior we have Wolford Mountain just over 65,000 acre feet located above shonne and called out by Shon Jr home stake um nearly 45,000 acre feet located above shonne and called out by shonne Jr and then lastly rudai Reservoir just over 100,000 acre feet Bel located below shonne up the frying pan River um and called out by a cameo senior call um so now that we've kind of gone through the Trans Mountain diversions and reservoirs I did want to spend um a little bit of time just talking about the two main um calling large calling water rights on the main stem Colorado River um the first one being the shason power plant um or the call water rights associated with the shason power plant that power plant is located in Glennwood Canyon just Upstream of Glennwood Springs um it's located right off the river so you've all probably driven by it um as your um cruising down I70 the the other major call we see on the main stem Colorado River is that associated with the Grand Valley irrigators um which we refer to as the Cameo call um the main structure there being the roller Dam um located in debec Canyon on the main stem Colorado River just Upstream um before you kind of as you're going west before you get into um Palisade in Canyon so um just getting to the shason power plant it has two two priorities or two water rights the senior priori is a 1905 priority in the amount of 1250 CFS um and then it has a junior priority for an additional 158 CFS with a 1940 priority um this uh for a total of 1408 as you can see between the the senior and Junior water rights at shonne um I think one important thing to characterize about the shonne power plant and its water rights are the fact that you know it's a hydr power um or water rights associated with producing Hydro power so it's a yearr round call um which is certainly different or can be distinguished from the call at Cameo which is associated with irrigation water rights which are seasonal calls um typically just during the irrigation or portions of the irrigation season um so the Shon power plant um you know certainly as with any hydr power plant um you know especially one located in Glenwood Canyon has had um doesn't always doesn't always have the ability to fully operate um in 2007 it had a pen stock breach which is actually shown in this picture here um which resulted in a a prolonged outage of the power plant additionally as you're all aware we had the Grizzly Creek fire in 2020 um and the associated debris flows after that um that caused uh difficulties in operating the plant um at Shon additionally on top of all of that if you know natural disasters weren't enough the plant itself is an older power plant with um certainly with aging infrastructure that can be difficult and timec consuming to repair so with all that being said um there are times when when the Shon power plant um goes down and cannot operate at its full capacity when that happens as Jen referenced um we we operate under the shason outage protocol and what that is is it's it's whenever that senior Shon call cannot be fully exercised for the 1250 CFS what this physically means is one or both of the hydrop power units are not operational at the plant meaning that it couldn't call for water to be put to its decreed beneficial use of Hydro power with that being said the protocol does provide um an agreement between parties to basically operate as if there was a call in place at shonne so during the non-winter season which is defined as April uh excuse me March 25th through November 10th what that looks like is um is basically the parties will operate as if there is a senior Shon call in place for that 1250 CFS um this differen Ates from the 1408 that shonne could call for under its Junior priority um if uh if the plant was actually fully operational uh the protocol during the winter season which is defined as November 11th through March 24th provides that um the parties will operate as if there was a senior Shon call but only for 900 CFS which obviously um differs from the 1250 senior right or the 1408 um that shason could be calling for under their Junior there's an exception to this for a cumulative of 17 days during January and February which really is a consideration of the fact that the plant um historically had some maintenance that occurred in that time frame of the year um one another important thing to characterize about the Shon aish protocol is that it's really only applies to the parties that are signator to the agreement so non-parties um may continue to divert under their own priorities as if there was no no call at shonne so I you know we don't view it or administer it as a hard traditional call water rights administration at shonne given um that these parties who are not or the non-parties to the agreement can continue to divert as if there were no call um there's also as Jen alluded to there's some opt-out Provisions whether they be volumetric as far as how much an entity May participate under shop in any given year there could be drought related op out Provisions based on um conditions with the the the amount of water stored in a current entity system as well as just cause in the in the case of the Bureau of Reclamation um this is just a table of kind of the uh 2022 irrigation year um and the status of the call at the Shon power plant I think notably is is just the prevalence of a call at this location the plant is is operating it can also be seen here that this in this particular year there were some operations under the outage protocol given that the plant wasn't operating um specifically in in the first part of April as well as May through July although I would note that some of those or majority of that time frame in May through July um it was during runoff so there was adequate flow um so there was although shop was operating there was no real call under the outage Pro protocol given that there was more than 1250 CFS um at the doero gauge this is a graphic that shows that Administration um at doero in 2022 I think specifically to note here um is that 900 this red line depicts the 900 CFS flow Target for the shonne op outage protocol operations um during the winter season and as you can see by these two blue bars here and here on the shoulder seasons of the hydrograph or the um the two limbs of the hydrograph we did operate the uh Shon outage protocol during those times and it was effective in um in keeping 1250 CFS um at thezero gauge so that's just a graphic that depicts those operations in 2022 moving on um Downstream to the next major calling water rate on the mains Colorado River we have what's referred to as the Cameo call um this is a a set of water rights associated with the Grand Valley irrigators um composed of of these entities identified on the slide these are just some pictures this is the roller Dam here in debec Canyon um this is the uh the infrastructure at Orchard Mesa which is includes um both a hydraulic pumping station where they're actually using hydraulic pumping to lift water up to Orchard Mesa for its decreed beneficial use of irrigation this is the Hydro power plant um at Orchard Mesa and then this is the uh the headgate at the Grand Valley irrigation company Canal so the water rights associated with The Cameo call um total uh 2350 um CFS physically what can be carried is 2260 so that's historically been known as The Cameo demand that 2260 CFS um a huge aspect of administration of um the call at Cameo is a result of the Orchard Mesa check case that Jen previously referenced um this was a case um where the applicants were the Grand Valley Water users Association Orchard based the Irrigation District and the United States the whole purpose of it was to confirm this appropriative right of substitution and exchange of 640 CFS with a 1926 priority the Upstream termin uh Terminus is associated with the roller Dam in debec Canyon where the water's diverted um and with the downstream Terminus being the um Grand Valley irrigation company diversion Dam again the whole purpose of this application and case was um to allow diverting more water for the non-consumptive hydrop power and Hydra hydraulic pumping uses while still keeping um the senior water right associated with the Grand Valley irrigation company hole um it is important to be mindful of the fact that you know some of these the structures or the uses at the structures being the the power plant plant and the hydraulic pumping station that Orchard Mesa uses um that those are non-consumptive uses so that water is then either uh checked back to the Grand Valley irrigation company um to keep that water senior water right whole this is just a schematic of um of the diversion of water at the roller Dam in debec Canyon where it's then taken under the Colorado River by siphon and it's delivered um through this Orchard Mesa Canal both to the power plant to generate power through the pumping plant that's the hydraulic pumping plant that lifts where water is actually used to lift other water to irrigation on top of the Mesa and then this check structure which um which basically checks the non-consumptive use of that water back to the gvic diversion to keep that senior water right hole these are just some pictures of the associated infrastructure um with the check as Jen alluded to what seemingly was a pretty straightforward application in Water Court turned out to um gain a a tremendous amount of attention with opposition in that case um while the decree is fairly straightforward um and it grants The Exchange right it's only nine pages long I believe the stipulation certainly um is much more complex um it outlines the operations of the check and how to exercise the decrees retain jurisdiction um as well as uh kind of gets into other Administration um associated with the historic users pool at Green Mountain res ofor um so one specific thing to note about the stipulation um is that paragraph 3A prevents the United States from calling um for its 400 CFS water right during the irrigation season um and basically what that gets us to is is the 1950 of water rights that can be called for after this stipulation which is what Jen referenced previously arguably even more important is this paragraph 3B of the stipulation um and what this provides is is that the diversions by the historic users pool beneficiaries um cannot be curtailed by a cameo call if the three following criteria are met the check is operable physically um that there was at least 66,000 acre feet stored in the Green Mountain reservoirs historic users pool so it filled completely and in the context of our conversation that the Shon power plant continues to exercise its water right consistent with its historical operation so basically this is the key provision here and what what the operation of the shason outage protocol provides is consistency with this criteria um to ensure that the this criteria is met for paragraph 3B of the stipulation which again as we get to the discussing the implications of of no call at shonne um you'll see there will be some some cascading effects of of this criteria potentially not being met um paragraph five of the the stipulation also provides um some criteria for operating that historic users pool um it defines how the S any surplus water in the historic users pool might be utilized um it defines kind of uh the rate and timing of the releases out of the historic users pool depending on on what call we're looking at Downstream um so as you can imagine the stipulation is is very important and it's something that our office is constantly using um to administer the the main stem Colorado River this uh this graphic here shows 2020 2021 operations and basically the draw down of the historic users pool over the course of the irrigation season there's these two bands the drye lower and upper bands um that that operations are we attempt to stay Within These to ensure that there's adequate um hup water available for the duration of the irrigation season um this is just a graphic showing the call the 2022 call at Cameo um the natural flow here in green um the targeted natural flow is what is the amount that the uh irrigators were calling for throughout the season as you can see it's pretty much at 1950 for a majority of the Season it does tend to dip down a little bit as they don't see as high of a demand towards the tail end of the irrigation season as we approach the end of um end of October But ultimately these these yellow bars show at the times when the Cameo call was was being administered and show you know how we're meeting um ensuring that that calling water right is is staying whole through our Administration this uh final graphic for the large calling water rights just shows the historic IAL calls on the main stem Colorado River in dark red we have the call number of call days at shonne in Orange we have the number of call days at Cameo I think the big take-home here is obviously given that the water rates associated with shason are are for hydr power year round use um we have much larger numbers of days of call associated with the shason power plant than we do with the with the Cameo call um associated with the irrigation rights at the bottom of the system I'm quickly go through um the Upper Colorado River endangered fish recovery program because it certainly um is is a key driver of administration within division five and something um we're constantly working with these are the four spe species of endangered fish that are part of the program um what we're talking about is that 15 Mile reach which again extends from the tail race of the Orchard Mesa power plant all the way down um to the Confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers um this uh this is a critical section of Reach For Those endangered species um it's been certainly dewatered um from from operations um as well as the diversion dams are barriers barriers to um habitat connection and certainly fish loss to to the diversion structures themselves so the whole purpose of this program um it had this programmatic biological opinion signed in December of 99 um it basically allows um an umbrella opinion that allows projects to occur in Li of an individual section seven consultations um it allows for the continued water development while also recovering the fish um so it's certainly beneficial for projects um it it found Esa compliance for existing depletions of approximately a million acre feet per year as well as future depletions um in the ballpark of 120,000 acre feet per year on the from the Upper Colorado River um the goals of the program are to um ensure that fish populations are improving of those endangered species as well as habitat Improvement um the actions of the of the program include installing fish ladders fish screens stocking of fish um and what we'll focus on here is this flow augmentation to help habitat kind of the flow augmentation comes in two different forms we're talking about either enhanced Peak flows during the the runoff season as well as low flow targets which we're typically looking at towards the um later end or towards the uh back end of the irrigation season so in regard to those Peak flows um they're looking for 12,900 CFS to 25,000 CFS um you know certainly these high flows are important for moving a sediment M Channel maintenance creating habitat um additionally um you kind of have to be careful of the higher flows because there are some flooding implications Downstream as well so it's a little bit of a a balance um but certainly the whole purpose of the this is to generate high flow targets or meet these high flow targets um this is done through what we refer to as the coordinated Reservoir operations which are basically voluntary operations to rtime um Reservoir bypasses to increase that Peak magnitude Andor duration of of peak flow um while not impacting Reservoir yield so cross operations are not something that can occur every single year they are voluntary um but when when conditions allow um the parties do try to attempt to um to operate under cross this is just a schematic showing cross operations um again with the the peak flows um shown in red and what it would have been without cross releases in blue um so as you can see there's a a measurable difference in the amount of peak flow that was able to be added in 2019 with those cross operations the next aspect of that flow augmentation program are those low flow targets um which can depend on the type of hydrologic GE we're looking at um these are kind of the general targets depending on the type of year um the flow augmentation is typically coming in the form of releases out of pools in certain reservoirs namely grany Wolford and Rudi reservoirs um which are kind of have the the again these fish pools I would say um Green Mountain Reservoir while it doesn't have a dedicated quote unquote fish pool um one of the the uses that can be allowed of the hup Surplus water is um to benefit the 15 Mile reach so this is an incredibly important component or meaningful contribution to um to flow augmentation for the program is this hup Surplus water as you can see here it's got It's been anywhere from not zero contribution in certain years to upwards of over 50,000 acre feet um and averages roughly 25,000 acre feet per year so relative to all of these combined pools you can see it's a meaningful uh contribution to that flow augmentation um potentially over 50% of It On Any Given year these are just graphs showing that flow augmentation program um and its Effectiveness over V various years 2010 201 11 um and 2012 just showing the difference between um the flows with the reservoir releases and the flows that uh we would expect if those releases had not occurred um certainly when you're looking at potentially completely drying up the 15 Mile reach um that is certainly concerning um which is certainly one of the benefits of the program so I kind of wanted to wrap up this presentation by talking about um referring to the potential implications of not having a Shon call or Shon outage protocol operations um in place and and I try to think of this as a bit of a spectrum where we on one end we have the Shon call which is just traditional water rights Administration when the plant is is operational and water can be diverted to its decreed beneficial use where we we just administer those water rights what I would characterize as a hard call I mean this is just traditional water rights Administration with those two priorities on the other end of the spectrum we have the you know no call at all which is kind of going to be the focus of the rest of my presentation and in the middle um we kind of have these operations under shop um certainly shop I would say does try to attempt to mirror the river conditions an Administration associated with the shason call it again it it meets the criteria in the Orchard Mesa check case stipulation um but there's certainly some exceptions to shop that I kind of previously pointed to and and we'll reiterate um versus a traditional Shon call one is the fact that it's temporary in nature only through 20156 as as Jen pointed out it's limited to to the participating parties the signators to the agreement um it has a summer Target of 1250 um versus only which is only associated with the senior water R versus the 1408 um that shason could be calling for under its Junior water right um if it was operational the winner Target of 900 CFS is certainly less than than the senior and Junior water rates at shonne of 1250 and 1408 again those volumetric limits that may limit uh participation in shop as well as the drought related opt out Provisions so with all that being said um I will kind of spend the next last few minutes here just talking through the potential implications of there not being a Shon call or shop operations at Shon um a few disclaimers that I just wanted to point out quickly are that you know this is all really based on our staff's knowledge of the system and how it's administered um dwr staff has not been involved in any modeling um that has been performed for any sort of verification um as you can see from this presentation it's a very dynamic system it's certainly complex um and this is by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of of any implications um there's also cascading effects that be difficult to project um based on some of them might be dependent on on water user choices um so that being said we'll just start with the potential implications to Trans Mountain diversions again the implications associated with not having a Shon call um what we would probably expect to see if that were the case would be a shift in diversions Andor replacement for outof priority diversions um associated with those trans mountains projects um above shonne what we'd be looking at is due to the fact that there wouldn't be a shonne call those diversion projects Trans Mountain diversion projects may have more yield Andor less replacement from reservoirs again due to the fact that there's less um less occurrence or or no occurrence of call at shonne below shonne we would expect the Trans Mountain diversions um to to maybe potentially have less yield and or more replacement from reservoirs again due to this a longer deeper Cameo call because you wouldn't have the shonne call pulling down natural flow that would partially help satisfy the Cameo call we would anticipate a longer deeper Cameo call which I'll get to here shortly as far as the potential implications to some of the larger reservoirs um above shonne we would expect that those reservoirs would have lower releases with given that they'd have less replacement need for Trans Mountain diversions um this would ultimately result result in lower stream flows below those reservoirs as well as potentially higher temperatures which is something that we've seen um not necessarily this past year but certainly years previous where we run into high temperature issues on the Colorado River um above shonne we'd expect these larger reservoirs to have greater storage going into runoff given that they're going to be relied on less um we'd have an increased likelihood of uh spills and Peak flows during runoff um and a higher likelihood of of fill um so really This lends itself to potentially potentially having greater ability to to perform cross operations if you're not relying on these reservoirs above shason if they're not being drafted on as hard um throughout the irrigation season meaning that they'll have less to fill um going into the fill season and and a greater frequency of spilling and higher Peak flows on the other hand these larger reservoirs below Shon we might anticipate that we'd see higher releases um associated with the more additional replacement water um again kind of driven by that longer deeper Cameo call you might expect to see higher stream flows below the reservoirs in the summer but lower stream flows um below those reservoirs in the winter and that really being associated with the fact that those reservoirs would likely be drawn on harder and might not have as greater flexibility in operations over the winter where they would just be releasing their bare minimum um to ensure that they they fill as much as possible during the following fill season we'd likely see um Less storage going into runoff decreased spills Peak flows during runoff and a lower likelihood of fill again associated with those large reservoirs below Shon getting into the Cameo call um again we would anticipate a longer deeper Cameo call if there was no call at shonne um what this is going to provide for is you know those diversions um priority diversions might have less opportunity to actually be diverted with a longer deeper Cameo call we might see a greater frequency of April calls at Cameo um as well as you know certainly an administrative concern is the fact that there's many plans for augmentation um located below shonne that are set up to replace injury associated with the historical worst case call scenario at Cameo so certainly if that was to become uh greater longer in duration the call being longer in duration in the future there's a potential that those plans may not work as well um and potentially I guess even a bigger implication here is this paragraph 3B of the Orchard Mesa check case um you know if if if it's determined or if shonne is not operated as it historically has then that uh paragraph 3 be if the stipulation would not be met um which would result in a couple things the 6 6,000 acre foot hup pool may not be adequate for those West slope um diversions that were perfected prior to October 15 1977 and what that means is if we were to ever get to a situation where we drew down the historic users pool to nothing um and this and this condition wasn't met we may have to look at curtailing those West slope water users even though they've historically benefited from the historic users pool they might not be afforded that protection given this criteria wouldn't be met um another provision of this is that the call at Cameo could be upwards of 2260 CFS um versus the 1950 that's currently limited to pursuant to the check case stipulation um and lastly is this concept of the hup Surplus um so if the 66,000 acre foot h Pool may not be adequate for those West slope uses then certainly there wouldn't be an ability to declare Surplus out of that pool which would have a potential implication to the amount of or the fact that none of that Surplus or there would be no Surplus to deliver to the 15 Mile reach um this would impact it impact the Colorado River main stem we'd likely see lower flows during the shoulder Seasons when that hup Surplus water has historically been utilized so this is my last slide um the fif potential implications to the 15 Mile reach um again that paragraph 3B of the stipulation in the Orchard Mesa check case would not be met hup Surplus couldn't be declared and there'd be significantly less water for release to the 15 Mile reach again given that that source of water can be upwards of over 50% of the contributions to the 15 Mile reach in any given year um we'd likely see more storage and reservoirs above shonne again this would getting back to to the first slide a few slides ago we'd maybe see increase spills Peak flows and potential for greater cross operations during runoff um and we'd likely see more maybe more reliably stored water in those fish pools in Wolford and grany um for releases to the 15 Mile reach one thing to note here I think is is the the difference in magnitude between the two is is that by losing the hup Surplus water you're likely um would not be offset likely by the water gain in the fish pools in Wolford and grany um so it's not by any means I wouldn't view it as a as an even tradeoff given the significant contribution of that hup Surplus water um another implication to the 15 Mile reach is that less less storage in in reservoirs below Shon um namely Rudi Reservoir that four out of five pool which is a 5,000 acre foot pool for releases to the 15 Mile reach might not be um as reliable moving forward if Rudy were drawn on harder we'd likely see that longer Cameo call which would result in less natural flow in the 15 Mile reach um we would potentially see an additional amount of water called beyond the 1950 CFS um one thing to note about that water is it would mostly go to hydr Power um which would be returned to the 15 Mile reach so that's one place where you might see some additional flow to the 15 Mile reach if um if the call was uh was made for 2260 um but ultimately I think the big big picture implication is that it's going to be more challenging likely to meet those flow targets associated with the recovery program so with all of that um that's all I have uh for my presentation I'm happy to take questions okay Jen are are you good to go to questions for Caleb is yes let's go to questions yeah okay are there questions I just want to comment thank you very much that was a very thorough tour through division five and uh all the complexity that it entails thank you you're welcome and I'm sorry Dres uh Caleb great job is there any way you could pull up that very first handwritten map you had yes I all I asked questions yeah just give me one second okay now that you've walked us through all of it now I want to go back and see the perspective of it if that's okay yeah no for sure sorry about that let's see all right how's that is that the one you're looking for yes thank you okay so when I'm looking at this map and I see um the locations um I if if Shon is not calling and we have the agreements for non-all by the upper diversions the water passes down through it can service those irrigators below down by the Confluence is that correct yeah that's correct and the major reason for that being is the fact that you again the Shon and power plant water right is not only is a year round water right for Hydro power but it's more or less non-consumptive right so although it's calling water and diverting it to beneficial use it's it's returning it back right back to the main stem Colorado River several miles Downstream of the point of diversion um so yes that water then continues its way down down the river okay so if shonne doesn't call for their water and we have the no call agreements um in place I'm I need I guess the risk then is to how it's going to impact the downstream irrigators in the 15 Mile reach because it's a non-consumptive use um what we're trying to do is make sure that the larger Trans Mountain diversions don't absorb the Shon call if the power plant ever goes out of business but with the stipulations maybe not the right word but the agreements with Denver Water and the other Trans Mountain diverters to no call isn't that water protected anyway or and I understand my question is way too simplistic but what what are what are the nuances because you did an excellent job of running through the criteria at the end but it it seems like the flows are protected because it's a non-consumptive and it's protected because there's already agreements in place for no call which would then limit the Transmountain diversions or the reservoirs above so then I guess I need a little more clarification of of what this goes to and I think I maybe I need a little clarification as far as your reference to the no call agreements I think you know the the shason protocol agreement basically you know the parties to that agreement operate even when shon's not physically operating it more or Le they more or less um it tries to mimic mimic their operations as if there were some some some call at the shonne power plant so meaning that you know they let's say um the shonne outage protocol is being operated for instance today um and you know depending on the amount of natural flow in the system um for instance there's not any Replacements being made for the CBT project um so I think I guess I'm struggling with I I guess I don't fully understand so I I mislabeled that so it's not a no call on the Shon it's so the Shon when they make their call they're generating power the stream reaches wet they call that water down past correct um if the if shonne is not calling for their right there are already agreements like if they're offline there's already to shop and those agreements so the water continues passed those are contingent not on whether shonne operates but on whether the Transmountain diverters agree or disagree to not call that water out from those those priorities below that's the call I'm speaking to not the Shon right the Trans Mountain diversion calls I guess yeah and I I mean I think there's just a difference between um basically there the signators to the shonne outage protocol are agreeing even when shon's down to to continue to operate as if shonne was calling um so it's it's kind of I mean with those exceptions that I identified certainly it's not the same necessarily as a traditional call at shonne because of the maybe some of the opt out provision or the lower flow targets namely in the winter being 900 versus 1250 I mean a really great example I guess of the 9250 happened just the other day on November 11th you know where we had um I believe I want to say roughly a thousand CFS of natural flow coming down the river what happened is on November 11th if we if shonne was up and running and was calling for its senior waterite in the amount of 1250 CFS we would be administering to that water right under the Shon outage protocol agreement the target changes to 900 CFS on on that day so what that resulted in is was an adjustment of the call because we had more than than 900 CFS and what that basically provided was that there were um you know replacements for uh the Colorado Big Thompson project no longer had to be released because of that change in flow Target whereas if sh was actually operating you know that those releases would have been made for the outer priority diversion um okay so I'm not sure I necessarily answered your question no no you're you're helping I'm sorry I have to I kind of like Circle my way into understanding this it's a it's a big complex system and I appreciate you having the patience with me so I'll uh I'm GNA I'm going to ponder a little farther and then go on okay thank you director Brody may have some light to shed yeah I can maybe help answer that and um Peter Fleming might have some additional context that he wants to share so each of the agreements with the various Trans Mountain divergers have different caveats different time limits associated with them so for example in in Denver Waters case as spelled out in the crca Denver's commitment to honor the out the outage protocol is permanent but it's also contingent upon the relaxation agreement also being made permanent and as you heard um from from our Council right now that is a Time limited agreement um potentially subject to Renewal but that's all to be determined uh the other Trans Mountain diverters you know each have their own somewhat different Provisions different end dates you know and and different conditions for honoring that so I think you know one one thing to just be mindful of is the the current body of the various shop agreements um isn't permanent in in in in any sense today questions for Caleb thank you Mr chair um I've been pretty uncom able in a stage talking about water before but when we have the AG's office the state engineer Caleb another 15 attorneys that have negotiated some of these deals and then a Rancher is gonna talk about Shon it's like I got this guys so what occurred to me you know in reading the board packet uh Caleb's presentation which is wonderful but as I've been thinking about this I guess living in division five and having water rights out of the main stem I guess I've been numb to the word she shown because it's like I think the whole state is everybody should be and I guess I realize that maybe that's not the case as the river system works that is so complex in the upper portions and I'll speak pretty specifically to Grand County but that call on shonne basically set up the system for how all of the substitute reservoirs the trans Bas and diverters how the whole thing went to go and so all summer long like our River behavior is being directly tied to either the shown water right or chop at a current time and then I think that also for the West slope what was identified with the relaxation call is that after we saw 0203 in Grand County it also doesn't do the West slope our state anybody any benefit if we don't have any westlo storage facilities with any water in them right and so there's this balance of you know we built a system we saw a drier time period relaxation came to be you've got chop and all these things are I would say working together in agreements as we learn more about how the system operates so that it can kind of maximize benefits to everybody but it is you know I should open my emails and it's like division watt resources if you're living main stem and you're on their email list for the call in the Colorado River it's five times a week you're on a roller coaster about what's happening with shonne it's it's telling the whole system and all of its users like what is going to happen with it so from that West slope perspective and I think that you could see like with all of the support from the headwaters community and counties you know it's pretty clear and I would even say correct me if I'm wrong but dating back to Senate document 80 it was identified the importance of the shonne call on the main stem I think clearly within the crca and all the negotiations and agreements again same story We recognize as a state how important you know that water right is to be there and so I think that when you know Caleb's giving this description and we're all sitting here thinking about things it is tough because like for Denver um shops in place in perpetuity if the relaxation cost correct but how many other transbasin diver diverters either have a well I guess how many how many don't have any obligation to that I think all of the major tmds do and Peter can correct me if I'm wrong on that well so with that I I just I felt an obligation to you know the rest of the board and people here as we're in this conversation I'm excited to hear from the River District but when you live main stem Colorado River like it is Shon is what calls the system it's how we all live and I think generally speaking with some corrections because that's what I mean 0203 up there and everyone ran out of water and it's awful and like I see the relaxation thing as being actually a pretty important part of this if we're thinking about it through a state lens but then I also think of the trickle down effect of potential impacts and probably inappropriate today but like from Upstream of shonne if the shonne call doesn't exist there's probably different water users that are going to be impacted by other calls that would take place speaking above shason and that has never historically been an issue so for everyone that's currently relying on the system functioning as it does there would be you know a number of changes so with that I will conclude thanks okay or thoughts from the board in this discussion to hear from the River District I believe so okay thank you excuse me um my name is Peter Fleming I'm general counsel at the Colorado riverwater Conservation District I know almost all of you um I want to thank the board very much uh and the uh cwcb staff for the time that you've dedicated to this matter today I'm G to try not to take up too much of your time I know um people are probably um starting to get a little hungry for lunch um uh with me today um from the River District is our general manager Andy Mueller uh director of governmental Affairs Zan Kessler uh director of technical advocacy Brendan langen Housen and I did want to introduce as well um our new associate Council Bruce Walters he's also here behind me he comes to us from the Attorney General's office recently so um thank you and apologies uh um attorney general Wier and Jen and Scott who I think is back there as well um we're really excited to have have Bruce on board um at the River District uh in addition I believe that online although I have not checked independently that um we have um from our partner um Public Service Company uh EXL energy um Fran Fen uh a um corporate counsel uh as as well as Brad McLoud with the governmental Affairs Department there and um Rich belt as well uh in case there are any specific questions of um um Excel staff um I wanted to thank again um uh Jen and Caleb for that um very detailed and good presentation um unfortunately it reminded me that that out of The Four Agreements that that Jen referenced and Caleb talked about um that I I think I signed or signed off on on three of them and kind of three and a half of them really because we did have some input in the 2007 call reduction agreement agement between Denver and EXL even though uh the River District is not a not a party um but the the 1996 Orchard Mesa check case that complicated case down in the Grand Valley um I did sign that on behalf of my client it wasn't my current client so um but but that kind of um uh ages me a little more than I was comfortable with that's really only my qu my only quibble with with uh any of the summaries that you guys um uh gave of those agreements and their impact on the river so really good job and I appreciate that very much um so um obviously uh um uh we're we're not seeking any action we're not requesting any action from the cwcb today um we do appreciate the the time we we view today's meeting and really the interm after the September finance committee meeting and um going forward um up until hopefully the um uh January board meeting as a as way to further our partnership with the cwcb um we really um believe is it's not we can believe it or not it's actually has to be the fact we have to have the water conservation board the state of Colorado as a a full partner um in this effort because uh we cannot achieve the shason permanency that has been long contemplated by all of the West slope entities um that have been supporting and pursuing this project for so many so long um without um uh the cwcbs effort because the cwcb is the only entity in the state that can um use water for instream flow purposes for without involving a diversion of any sort and um and really that's what we're talking about for this Shon permanency effort is uh you know the river District's acquisition of that water right um entering into a a a lease agreement with um the current owner to lease it back to them to use it for hydropower purposes for as long as they wish to continue to do so um but during such times such as this year uh when there's been an extended outage um uh due to some maintenance and rockfall concerns um when it can't be used for hydropower purposes it would be used for instream flow purposes and it would be used solely by the state by the by the cwcb for instream flow purposes to maintain all of those benefits that that Caleb went through that that director Bret talked about um and today we really are at a a a historic moment um in in our um uh pursuit of shason permanency it's it's a it's a Confluence if you will of of of many factors and it goes to explain as well as why we're making making this ask uh uh now not today of course but U at this time period and that is the the Confluence of of the um you know we we now have uh you know a willing seller a good partner in in public service we have um uh incredible U Federal funding opportunities we have incredible State and State support both from the River District and from our uh local West lope partners who we um anticipate will be uh committing up to $30 million as part of of this effort and there also is of course a um a a pretty good uh supply of money available to the state um that we are making this request of of the state or pending um Grant application um so um you know a big a big convergence there that um in in my long term at the River District we've never come come close to that um and and so it it has really made us all very excited um the current status of that purchase and sale agreement when we talked to you in in um September we anticipated that it would be executed in late October there was a delay in the approval process and uh we now anticipate that that approval process will go forward in mid December um we don't have a specific date yet but we we think it'll be right in that time frame so we are very hopeful um that by the January board meeting um we will have an executed um purchase and sale agreement but even though we don't yet have that we are still taking steps to further our partnership with the water conservation board in particular working with the staff a little bit more we're trying to um I believe we're very close to having a um agreement that allow us to share some documents that um we would otherwise consider confidential we're also pursuing similar agreements with some of the um large Transmountain diversion entities so that we can um talk about with them questions that they rightfully have about how the instream flow change case might be um considered and and pursued um so we very very much appreciate the board's um uh uh willingness to um consider holding off on the request the grant request until a later date um it's I think that will really help in fact um you know really as we speak we're help we're we're working both with Parks and Wildlife staff cwcb staff and our own private Consultants on developing and and refining some of the technical and and supporting biologic and um um um geomorphology um uh science that we need to to will be needing to present to support the um uh one of the key components in this which of course is the instream flow agreement once we have the signed PSA the concept is we will then negotiate with the Colorado water conservation board staff and eventually of course the board the terms of a instream flow agreement and so that hasn't been negotiated yet that that's you know a key component that's really step one in one once the PSA the purchase and sale agreement is executed um and that will include all sorts of of of terms about um uh you know how the instream flow would be operated um and then after that is done uh we would go forward together hand inand we would we would anticipate and hope uh to the water court and ask for the water Court's blessing on that agreement that would guide how the instream flow would be operated when the water right is is not being operated for hydropower purposes I want to um uh respect the board's time and other agenda items we did submit a um a memo to the um staff um uh that I I believe made it into your packets and a memo to the board as well same memo um that we think uh uh summarize some of the responses that we had to the questions that were asked during the finance committee I know there are other questions as you've heard it's a you know the the whole uh regimen of the Colorado River is is pretty complex and there's a lot of big complex agreements that have been developed over the years to manage it um and um you know this will be a an important part of that and and and frankly key but we need to me mesh in with all these existing agreements um I know you've dedicated a lot of time to this already I just want to make sure that you know that um the River District um and Excel we we are uh stand ready to come and and talk to you at and your staff at any time if it requires a special Workshop I don't want to oppose upon uh any more time than we already have but we're more than happy to do that um as you've heard this is a this is a complicated matter and we're willing to take whatever time it takes to um um explain um this to the greatest degree possible to help do that one thing I might say would would be you know in that in that complex Orchard Mesa check case that that um Caleb talked about and the inter relationship with the flows and the 15 Mile reach the programmatic biological opinion that's so important really not just to wet slope water users but to the state as a whole because it provides Endangered Species Act coverage for any project that needs any sort of federal action um but whether it be in Basin or Trans Mountain if I could summarize that in one way I guess I might say that the Shon water rights and the maintenance of the flows the historical Shon flows is the bottom card in the in the in the The House of the card you know the house of cards that is the 15 Mile reach PBO um and and the endangered species recovery program with respect to the 15 Mile re which is a pretty key component of the whole thing if that comes out um uh you know it's it's quite possible as Caleb explain that that the hup Surplus goes away the hup Surplus is uh the majority of the water that gets delivered in each and every year to the 15 Mile reach um before I forget director Brody asked about uh Trans Mountain diversions that were not subject to the um Shon outage protocol and um at least currently Colorado Springs which uh owns and operates the um a couple of um Trans Mountain projects it's a 5050 partner in the home state project in the Eagle headquarters of the Eagle River Basin owns and operates the um U Continental hooer um project which is in the headwaters of the Blue River is not currently um the River District hopes that in the near term they will become one we have good reason to believe that they will um and then all of the large Trans Mountain diversion projects that are in the frying pan and and Roaring Fork river basins those are Downstream if you will even though they're in the headwaters the The Roaring Fork obviously comes in right at Glennwood Springs a few miles Downstream of the shason power plant so those are not participants in the shash outage protocol because they're not subject to a to a shash call um so so uh I'll stop there um uh I'm happy to answer any questions we we'll take as long as you want but I I know you um probably anxious for lunch and a break thank you I I guess I'd like to ask a question that's all right um I've been struggling a little bit with the uh specific language in the memo and in the presentation in September and just really trying to figure out exactly what you're talking about it doesn't sound based on your comments just now this it doesn't sound like a call it a simple uh ultimately after the power plan is closed for good it doesn't sound like a simple cwcb instream flow acquisition in the sense that we take a water right and then use it according to both the historical precedent of that water right coupled with um the allowances that are in the statute for an acquisition uh and part of why I say that is you talked about negotiating the terms of this implementation or utilization of this water right negotiating that with cwcb staff and ultimately the board so I guess I'm wondering what is it that you would want to negotiate because right now I feel like there's just a there's a real Blank Spot it's a small one in the verbiage but it's a big one in my mind as to what it is we're really talking about Peter and um I'm hoping you can speak to that uh sure I'm happy to to uh thank you chairman phelp the um you know what uh is negotiated for that instream flow agreement with the water conservation board will be up to uh the parties and and those parties would be the River District the the current owner Excel Energy and the Colorado water conservation board so those terms have not been developed because we you know we haven't gotten to that stage yet but if I were if you were looking at it from the River District perspective and what are we seeking to come out of that process what would we like to come out of that process we would like to have an agreement where we we assign because at that time we would be the then owner of the water right we would assign to the cwcb the right to use the water right for instream flow purposes in perpetuity at all times for instream flow purposes when it's not being used for hydrop power and you mentioned at some point in time that the the the shy power plant goes away it may or may not but let's just assume that it that it will uh at some point in the future goes away um and if it does then the exercise of that water right would be for for the sole purpose of instream flow purposes the terms of that agreement would be subject to whatever terms we would negotiate with the water conservation board but they would include important elements that we have already pledged to other parties to contain one important one being the provisions of the 200 7 call reduction agreement that um first assistant Milly um mentioned you know we've got these two different agreements one's called the the shash outage protocol agreement and one's called the shash call reduction agreement they sound very similar and they're a little confusing but in some ways I like to think they do the the flip the 180 of each other the call reduction agreement provides protections uh it was negotiated by Denver and it was intended to benefit Denver but because of the way it operates it actually has benefits to other water users as well it doesn't assign a specific benefit to Denver Water it allows Denver under certain drought conditions to uh pay EXL under the current terms and there would be nobody to pay once the power plant goes away to reduce the call during those drought conditions and when it does reduce the call water becomes available in priority to Denver and to other water users in addition Denver agreed in that agreement uh to make a certain amount of the saved water if you will available um for use by Excel uh at its other power uh generation facilities and a certain amount for West slope purposes as well so that would be a key condition that would that we anticipate would be included but at the same time we would like to make sure that that water right you know except for you know that term and whatever other terms we would need to negotiate to achieve a stipulated um a deal that we'd like to make an agreement with everybody uh we'd like to have it uh be as protective of the resource as possible right we're in this at the at the from the West slope um for you know the primary purpose of replicating the historical operation of the Shon flows so we're not trying to take water uh away from anybody but we're trying to PR preserve those flows going into perpetuity so that water that has historically been in the river and has supported all of these things that we talked about and Caleb talked about uh uh in flows that you know go through the um wild and seek alternative management reach from um kremling all the way down to noname some 100 plus miles of river for recreation and fishing purposes um you know goes past director Bret's Ranch and down into the Grand Valley providing water quality benefits and evening out the flows for the benefits of the irrigators and the 15 Mile reach so those conditions continue forward going into the future and that we don't face the situation where uh the Water right is um effectively diminished or eliminated to the point that um the historical flow regime has changed to the significant um adverse impact of the West lope and state as a whole is that I hope that's responsive and I hope that helps to explain where we hope to be at the end of the day um I'm going to go to attorney general Weiser and then I think director Brody maybe had something to clarify on this particular question or because director Vasquez also had a so I did have a related question okay related to the instream flow and kind of how that fits into the proceeding but why don't you ask your question first then I can make my point director vascos has a complimentary question so um director Feld I do think you bring up an important point we need to understand kind of how the instream flow acquisition um fits into kind of the the order of this transaction and I had a question actually uh for councelor Milan and perhaps for Rob um because I do want to make sure that we're honoring the inam flow statute and we're not assuming a result before we've done the necessary analysis and so I'm glad to hear you're you're working on that analysis now but in terms of the the process that this Board needs to follow and again making sure that we don't prej prejudge um findings that we may later need to to determine as a board um where does that um board process prior to um prior to expressing an intent to appropriate an inam flow where does that fit in does that need to come before the board finalizes the instream flow acquisition agreement that Peter was just talking about can it come after just help us understand kind of that that sequence so that we understand kind of where where we need to take action excuse me how it normally works is that we have all the information typically from CPW on what those flow rates are that need to be protected to preserve or improve the the natural environment we have those going into our decision on on the acquisition of the water right so we know that if the water right is sufficient or is needed to protect what what we see as the necessary flows so does that have to happen before this agreement or can we do an agreement contingent or how how would that work I'll let Rob jump in here I I think an AG Rob V CWC St I think an agreement can be done I don't think we'd want to get into the specifics of the amount of the findings of what would be to preserve or improve the natural environment in that agreement because that would be the determination of the board itself not not not the staff thanks okay director Vasquez did you have a question directly related to this or are you gonna seed your moment here to attorney general Wiis okay all right so first I just want to thank the River District for your leadership stepping into what we recognize and I think the presentations that were offered highlight how important this is to the state I had what I thought was a very simple answer to to our chair's question so I want to offer the simple answer and I want you to tell me am I off on something under Cal law there only has been one entity who does own instream flow rights it's this board so this board would own the instream flow right and operate it is that your position or is it something different than that our position is that the cwcb would hold would be assigned By The River District the right to use the water right rights for instream flow purposes but is it revocable then on your theory that um would be subject to something that would be subject to negotiation there have been other instream flow agreements for uh the convers of existing water rights to instream flow purposes that have conversion Provisions in them so it's confusing me about this is from everything we've heard I believe this body what we've heard from the you know State Engineers office there's a clear alignment we need to keep this water in the river and the status quo in place if that's what's motivating it what I'm struggl understand is why wouldn't it be this becomes an instream flow light full stop second point and this gets to the tough sequencing the state's going to put up a bunch of money go to the feds to get more money and do we negotiate whatever has to happen before we do that or are you thinking that comes after because there's a to the extent what you're thinking about is something other than the conventional what we've always done with instream flow rights then I think there's some more questions and uncertainty to the extent it's like yes this is an instream flow right we know what it looks like this board's the board that holds it full stop it's it's a different situation yeah I mean I think that's effectively what we're saying is that the cwcb will hold the right and use the water right for instream flow purposes full stop the the only caveat on that is that are the the seller currently wants to continue to use the water right for hydropower purposes so long as the power plant is in operation we we will the you know the the proposed deal is that we as the owner of the water right would lease back to the to the seller the right to use the water right for hydrop power at its current location and for the current purposes so long as it wishes to continue to use it for that purpose once the power plant goes away because you know the the whole side of the Canyon Falls on it or the owner current uh EXL energy decides it's no longer in the business of operating the Shon power plant then the only use that gets made is instream flow use by the Colorado water conservation board all right I I don't want to get Excel here to have to say but I I think just to see if I've got it right an alternative structure could easily be Excel doesn't sell the right which would then be held by the state as inam flow right until it's with it that would be an alternative structure that would achieve the same result if we could convince the seller all right that's what I wanted to know thank you and they go to your second point on the on the what I think I heard about the um sequencing of the financing is that um uh we are hopeful again that the purchase and sale agreement would be executed um soon within a month or so at that time uh the Colorado River District would make a commitment to fund 20 million of the acquisition price our westlo partners we would seek that you know in due course to obtain firm commitments from them but we know from prior conversations that um we have a a coalition of the Willing there and um we are hopeful that the state of Colorado's commitment um would come in and be um you know put us at that 50/50 level with the um requests that we will be making and they' already initiated discussions with the federal government important point though there is everybody's money except for small relatively small amount that the River District is putting up as a down payment um uh all of that money you know none of it goes hard until the deal eventually closes several years down the road and and one of the key condition well many of the Key conditions are there negotiation of the instream flow agreement we just talked about the the um uh entry of a water Court decree final Water Court decree confirming the terms of the instream flow agreement uh and EXL has to go through a public utilities process Public Utilities Commission and we have to make sure all the funding is there if it if it doesn't close for any reason and in other words that we don't achieve shason permanency if the end goal is not achieved everybody gets their money back and you know none of the money goes goes hard that's that's how we we've contemplated the deal and the seller is aware of that just a final Point make sure I've got this the ordinary structure is the state owns the water right that is managed for inam soap instream flow purposes that is the ordinary structure by which this operates is that the structure you have in mind or you talking about something different I would say that is the ordinary but it is not the the always uh you know obviously there's the instream flow loan statute whereby water users can loan on a temporary basis water to the to the uh water conservation board and as I mentioned before there are other agreements um one in Pitkin County comes to mind where um uh there are reversionary aspects of water that that um uh goes through the statute contemplates um any means of of acquisition of the right to use the water for in for purposes it allows the water conservation board to take action on a on a loan on a donation on an acquisition on uh or any subter interest in the water right but again to be very clear about it is we're not talking about owning anything other than the actual title to the water right the use for the instream flow purpose that that that um is the purview only of the state is something that we see residing solely with the cwcb what I don't understand is why you're talking at all about owning a title for something that's use is in perpetuity and ordinarily managed by the state that's that's not quite making sense to me as something that is um outside of the way we tend to operate yeah I mean it's it I understand has a very large amount to do with the negotiations with the current owner and the current owner's desire to continue to use the water right for hydrop power purposes and the river District's role as uh the convenor if you will of a West slope coalition to try to package this deal together all right so on the both those points we can follow up on with the Excel point I I hear that point as for your convening role I appreciate you're helping to do that but I think I had thought your goal was to ultimately get to a status quo that's sustainable for the Western Slope as the state engineer talked about and that seems to be accomplished by an inam FL right that is owned by the state and this body and and and subject to the terms of the uh instream flow agreement uh you know we want to see the water right and the and the historic flows protected going into perpetuity yeah we're going to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal and and and that's all subject to negotiation director Brody thank you um following up on your point about the the funding not essentially going hard for some period of time um one of the things that's been on my mind since we last met is we learned new information about cwcbs funding available this legislative session um which unfortunately is not what we were necessarily hoping it was going to be when we met in finance committee a couple months ago um I don't want to put you on the spot to answer but one thing that I I would like you and Excel to think about is if um there might be some alternative way that the board could demonstrate its support this cycle that would allow the transaction allow the process to go forward um without tying up $20 million in this legislative cycle knowing that we're not going to spend that money for some two three I don't know how many years but it's not going to be this year it's not going to be next year in all likelihood um just as an alternative again I don't I would hate for that to to necessarily stop um this important process from proceeding but I also recognize that um we have more pressure on our budget this year and if if the money isn't actually going to be transferred could a resolution or some other type of demonstration of support um be sufficient for the parties to to move forward and then we could look at Appropriations in future years so again you don't need to answer just something to to think about before we meet again in January yeah thanks I guess just a couple of quick statements on that one is um you know we would love a firm commitment of the funds and you know the the concern is is twofold number one is we already know the um you know our friends at the capital are are looking to maybe um sweep some money from um the severance um uh funds that are available for these purposes um and so at least in our theory if it's committed by this board um you know it's it's sort of locked up and not you know not available for the legislature to divert to other purposes um number two we don't know what future Severance tax revenue will be and so we we're hoping to take advantage of this time of of you know relatively um Plum um uh revenue from the um Severance taxes um that said um you know again we you know we we very much appreciate the board's involvement the the a strong statement of support um is is better than no statement of support um but uh you know we we're really hoping and looking for um a strong commitment of of funding at this point director Vasquez yes I was going to ask some of the uh high level questions that have already been asked so I come down to a picky in question and that is in your note to us you indicated that you didn't think that there would be a change in seniority um should uh this right be converted to an instream flow and I'm curious not being a lawyer myself how that would work sure um in in an in a change of water rights proceeding um like what we're contemplating um and the and the and the instream flow agreement that's the the precursor to that um the utility the the strong benefit of that whole process is maintaining the the senior priority of of the water right so when you go through a change proceeding um you know everybody and their uncle gets to to weigh in and say well you know you need to insist upon X Y and Z terms can uh to to protect us but you get to maintain the existing priority of the water right even though you're going to use it for a new use and that's what you know we go through Water Court um uh process that happens every day in Colorado um although sometimes it takes many years to do um uh uh to in order to achieve those goals whether the water right is a senior water right uh that's been used for agricultural purposes that's now being converted to be used for municipal purposes the primary difference here is that um in many ways this this is a little simpler and I go back to to Chairman felt's um observation before about um uh you know is this a is this a a complic is this more complicated than the normal instream flow uh uh acquisition or donation type transaction and maybe in some ways because of the existing agreements because of the importance of the water right on the river that you that you just heard about but in many ways it's simpler because this water right is non-consumptive so you don't have to go through that um uh lengthy expensive and detailed ugly process about determining what the historical consumptive use was of a agricultural water right the historical timing and amount of the return flows of those water right where the where the return to the river and what Junior water rights depended upon those return flows the here the water is diverted goes through the penu two and a half miles Downstream and it comes back to the river I don't know how long that takes but it I I'm pretty confident it's less than a day and um and and so in in that respect it's it's it's a it's a simpler process that's not to diminish the significance of the project at all there any other questions Mr Fleming okay thank you thank you very much again we we really appreciate the time that you've dedicated in your um uh uh consider we do have one more question sorry thanks Mr chairman I just wanted to say thanks to Peter and then all of the River District folks that were here today you know for a showing to have this conversation with us so thanks for your time thanks I I we didn't come up with a signal before I was going to tap out there at a section but um I think we made it through the attorney general and I for a little bit there but appreciate it thank you okay thanks all right we got to make a few adjustments to our agenda here um attorney general Weiser has asked if he could do his attorney general's report report before lunch so we'll do that next then we will break for lunch probably a 30 minute lunch we're going to move items six and seven to after item 10 which is the report out from executive session clear as the Shon discussion I uh promise to be uh quick um first uh picking up on commissioner Greenberg's point about mental health I will in terms of the work of our office it has been front and center um as you know uh Mr chair the work on the opioid crisis has been something of great concern that I know has affected um rural Colorado in particular um we've now stood up 19 regions many of you here are somewhat familiar I know you are with yours um it's really been a great model of of bottomup um work um we're now focused on youth mental health with $32 million distributed from a settlement with Jewel related to a youth vaping crisis and a broader challenge that includes uh the impact of social media on youth mental health we sued um meta recently um owner of Instagram and Facebook I also um think about all the issues we're talking about in a similar Spirit depending on your favorite quote one of mine is uh all of us need all of us but I also think Ben Franklin's either we hang together or we hang separately conveys the message um this is a special Community I'm so sorry I wasn't here yesterday when Russ George joined us because his Spirit around that leadership is um something really special um he talked about working hard to ask two questions um what do you need and what can you give up um I think we just heard a good case about what we need around the shason um issue that we'll have to be working hard on and I know that uh from some of those in attendance the work of the uh inner Basin um compa commission is really an important um idea to have these roundtables um and I know that now having uh Becky Mitchell heading up the ibcc is giving a little more bandwidth to our DNR head which is great to see and I've not been able to join this year so I don't know that I've officially welcomed our new executive director um it's thrilled it's great for us to have such a seasoned and accomplished um policy wonk if I will um at the helm who knows these issues so well it's it's a special community and it's great to have your leadership and finally I'd be um remiss not to acknowledge our state engineer who um has served our state with such great distinction and we leave a real vacuum thank you for your service as well on the work of a offs I will acknowledge and I think there's going to be more time for this around the drought task force a lot of really good conversations one picking up our DNR um director's leadership uh there's a clear consensus around Wildfire resilience in the connection to water and the importance of protecting water quality and as has already been noted there's a lot of discussion about what type of storage and what type of infrastructure projects are going to be important it was already mentioned um in the report earlier about um clean water um I'll get to an issue there in a minute on that um we need to look hard and long at how we're using this funding opportunity and make sure we make the most of it I'm worried that we're going to underinvestment of all kinds more adaptability of all kinds takes thought planning um and real efforts there are a lot of um issues that still lie in the balance one opportunity here is obviously more effective different types of measurement to help us with that resilience and adaptability uh using new technologies to that is a real opportunity and then an area that there's some promise but we need to lean into is reuse how we reuse water um and having more effective portable reuse so those are a few things we talked about in our letter um we we recognize there's a lot still happening in the C river that we're going to be watching um the lower Basin States having to get into reality is to me the biggest starting place but ideally we're going to get to a place that we're all asking how we work together on a series of challenges that our state has to meet and we don't have a ton of time to meet it we are now in the Supreme Court in the Rio Grand case for those who've not been tracking this Colorado's uh issues are uh adjacent because most of the dispute was essentially between Texas and New Mexico but there are broader legal issues that are going to be in the Supreme Court case so we're going to be working hard on it the um the US government unfortunately is sticking its nose into this case in a way that we don't think is necessary appropriate or constructive and so the states are effectively all lined against the US government at the Supreme Court level here the final issue I want to mention which gets to water quality is pasas um for those who've not been tracking this issue uh it's really important there has been some efforts to put some settlements on the table only for water providers by 3M and Dupont who are two of the main producers of these FAS or forever chemicals uh there are deadlines to opt out of those two settlements only for water providers but it's worth noting that uh the affected populations go well beyond just pure water providers obviously people who are near industrial uses so if you think about um the suncore plant and and individuals in Commerce City um that's an affected population or people you know in the El Paso County who are closer to an Air Force Base so there's a lot of affected parties water providers we know are an important one um we're going to be working both with the current settlements and more broadly on this issue anyone with concerns or questions you can email um our team at past co.gov um because the interest of time and lunch uh I don't want to um go on uh any further but if there are questions I'll happily take them all right thank you other questions for attorney general Weiser okay thank you thank you great to be here okay so we're going to break for lunch um a couple lunch advisories I guess if we don't have a dining room so uh we have this table uh so apologies but that was what was available to us so you can eat with your plate on your lap I guess and um I think we definitely have food for the board and staff and we have more guests than we anticipated so like to have board and staff get fed and then whatever's left over we're welcome to share and uh we'll take 30 minutes so it's 1:10 so we will be back to work at 1: 140 and we'll be starting with item nine at 140 we're in recess Zoom our meeting here wow just a lot of trivial conversations going on I guess great thank you everybody um so we are as I said we're going to go to Executive session next and then the report from executive session and then we'll jump back to item six and seven the wus updates and the scpp item but we might need Jen mey to inform our executive session you first um we are ready for item nine executive session my apologies I thought we were going to do agenda item six and seven before executive session no well we I guess we're not um thank you we are about to go into to Executive session during executive session we will consider items 9A and 9B on the board's agenda this session is authorized pursuant to the revisions of section 246 423a of the Colorado revised statutes I think we are now ready for a motion is there a motion to go into executive session so mov okay director Bret second by director Brody all those in favor of going into executive session say I post hey we are going into executive session so yep okay all right so we'll resume here in regular session with item six which is Waters of the United States updates um excuse me may I interrupt Mr chair yeah um can I do the report coming out of executive session before we go to agenda item six please what just because it's on the agenda sorry about that I'm really excited sorry now I've lost my okay um this is agenda item 10 uh the board went into executive session to consider agenda items 9A and 9B the discussion during executive session was limited to those items and no formal action was taken during executive session we are now out of executive session and on to item six thank you very much okay welcome Amy thank you director fault members of the board uh for the record this is Amy tic chief of the interstate Federal and water information section and for this uh update I'm actually going to hand it over to Andy nich with the Attorney General's office to provide an update to the board on uh Federal jurisdiction over Waters of the United so Andy thank you uh good afternoon board again for the record my name is Andy nich Assistant Attorney General with the federal Interstate water unit and I'm here to just give a brief update on Waters of the United States or what it's also known as wus um so Waters of the United States it's a term in the federal Clean Water Act that's referring to the scope of federal jurisdiction to regulate Waters um this specifically comes up in the context of Dred and fill permits or section 404 permits so think of requirements and permitting for construction of dams for filling of res uh F filling of wetlands um those sort of permit activities um now Waters of the United States was not defined in the Clean Water Act and so the scope of federal jurisdiction and the meaning of that term has been subject to about 40 Years of litigation um it's been up to the US Supreme Court multiple times um and more recently we've had dueling um back and forth on regulations as new administrations come in um from the core of engineers in the Environmental Protection Agency about what exactly is wus um so the updates that I wanted to give you all here today um are two main things that happened in 2023 um the a big one is that the core of engineers and Environmental Protection Agency passed a new rule the 2023 rules um to Define modus um it adopted the significant Nexus test um which is a term that had been used in some prior rules and had been referenced in some prior Court opinions um basically the significant Nexus test is whether or not a body of water say Wetland significantly affects other bodies of waters like a major river um it's a relatively broad test it extends to um a fairly great deal of waters um and feral jurisdiction over those Waters um those 2023 rules were subject to uh basically immediate Court challenges um like the rules that preceded it and implementation of those rules was enjoined in about 27 States uh not including Colorado the rules did go into effect in Colorado uh meanwhile there was a court case going through the federal courts that wound up in front of the Supreme Court um sacket vepa um that court case wasn't about the 2023 rule specifically um but it was about this significant NEX test um the court issued its opinion May 25th this year and they rejected that significant Nexus test um the test that they used instead and I'll just go over that briefly was the waters in questions say if you're looking at a wetland um the water must be adjacent to a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional Interstate navigable Waters and it must have a continuous surface connection with that water water making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the Wetland begins so this is a significantly um more restrictive test than the significant Nexus test it did limit um significantly the scope of federal jurisdiction and what is defined as Waters of the United States um so accordingly after the second decision the core of engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency they issued a revised rule um be consistent with the sacket decision so it removed that significant Nexus test that is no longer the test in effect and it instead applies that sack test that I just went through um those rules went into those revised rules went into effect on September 8th so the effect here in Colorado um now sacket was specifically about Wetlands but that test that I just described it also has implications for other bodies of waters thinkk um intermittent and ephemeral streams of which Colorado has quite a bit um the number that I've been hearing is that the second decision likely removed Federal Protection and Federal Regulation over about 50% of Colorado waterways and wetlands um Colorado is undertaking a stakeholder process right now to put in its own uh dredge and fill regulatory framework so we're not relying on the federal government and the Corp of Engineers so those are those two big updates right now um I I know we're a little behind schedule but I'd certainly be happy to answer any questions you might have thank you are there any questions on wus yes director Brody thank you director phelp setting up a new permitting process the new pering regime obviously a pretty big undertaking um and I don't want you to prejudge the stakeholder process but can you give us any insight as to kind of what that might look like how how the St might go about it you know I have not been involved in that stakeholder process um if that's a question the board is interested in that probably be a better topic for a different speaker to be honest I I do think it would be good for us to hear more about at the appropriate time maybe when we meet jointly with the water quality control commission yeah which is at during our next meeting if I understand right yeah okay any other questions okay thank you thank you next is item seven sister right okay I'm starting a second guest myself you're doing great I'm losing my confidence system conservation pilot program and conservation projects funded through bipartisan infrastructure law funds uh thank you so much and again for the record ostic with Interstate Federal and water information section and I am here today to talk about system conservation pilot program uh this is a decision item for the board um but I will keep it as brief as possible I know you all are pretty familiar with the scpp by now so um I believe it was just after your September meeting maybe the day after in fact uh that the Upper Colorado River commission voted to move forward with system conservation pilot program again in 2024 um but implementing a number of changes and I think that I I talked to you all about the changes that might be coming if they chose to move forward with it at the last board meeting um but just wanted to highlight what those are and what the ucrc voted on so first uh scpp in 2024 will uh be moving forward much earlier and in fact as director riss pointed out the application window is actually open uh the ucrc website people water users can go and apply if they'd like to uh the second big change is that there is a firm fixed pricing mechanism so we're hoping that'll make it a little bit easier to uh you know facilitate the process a little bit more straightforward for water users they know what they're going to get at the outset uh next um you know there were some issues around conserved consumptive use estimates and I think water users not being completely certain how they should go about estimating how much water they would conserve so to try to help with those complications we are requiring uh pre- meetings with with Wilson water group the ucc's consultant ahead of people submitting applications uh so those are some of the big uh process changes across the upper Basin that we're implementing but the other thing we're doing specifically in Colorado is providing an opportunity for folks to review applications that we receive um and we're going to make very very clear in the application process that all this information that people are providing will be subject to review um that would not include uh personal identifying information like phone numbers email addresses things like that but if anyone wants to get signed up to receive the applications uh we have created a dedicated uh email address here DNR forol spp state.co.us so we would just encourage anyone who wants to receive those applications to get signed up at that email address by December 18th 2023 and again anyone who signs up will receive the applications that we receive in Colorado and they'll have the uh opportunity to provide comments on those the other pretty big change here is um scpp 2024 will have a more limited scope and the goal here is to really prioritize projects that result in water conservation and also inform demand management feasibility questions and or support Innovation and local resilience like building resilience to long-term drought so you know the underlying goal here I think was to you know if we were going to do scpp again to do it in a way that really supports water users adapting to Drought so I move through that very quickly um I know we're a little bit behind but that brings us to this board's role in the scpp so as you all are very aware the Upper Colorado River commission is responsible for running the program and managing the program but this board has the opportunity to approve scpp as a water conservation program for pursuant to statute uh and to provide the protections offered in statute for consumpt historical consumptive use so that is what I am here today seeking from this board um and and I have another recommendation relating to projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law but maybe we should start here okay are there questions on the scpp director sakata thank you Mr chair thanks Amy um board members are you going to automatically send that to us or you want us to sign up I can just go ahead and consider you all signed up if you'd like I would yeah happy to get you on that list thanks are there other questions okay I actually had a hard time when I went to the ucrc website to find it I if you could recommend to them I don't you know make it a little easier to access sure yeah so you know I will say I believe last time I went to ucc's website there's kind of a banner at the top that says you know scpp 2024 and I found that that's the easiest place to click through to find it because there's a lot of resources on the ucc's website for the previous years of scpp which is all very helpful um but yeah we can certainly suggest they make it more accessible that you can just get right to the application well I would just say that um one I'm really happy to be having this conversation in November instead of March and I'm sure our agricultural Community appreciates that and two um as you know last March we had a long and painful conversation about scpp and how we all felt about it but I'm I just want to reiterate I think I said this in September maybe but I do want to reiterate that the idea that we're now prioritizing projects that Advance um drought resilience and conservation to to me it just gives this program so much more um validity and I have had conversations you know at the Water Conservancy districts that I serve in and at the round table and explaining this and while the the flaws are still there to some extent um people seem to really grasp this and appreciate the improvements and so I I too appreciate it and the thoughtfulness that was applied and it sounds to me like Colorado once again sort of led the upper Basin in this direction so anyway I'm I'm surprised to be supportive but I'm pleased that I can be supportive so yeah so I don't know if there's any other comments or if there's a motion to uh on the staff recommendation director Colmes make a motion for staff recommendation on item seven second from director Brody any other comments discussion director Sak are we going to discuss the system other program the what bipartisan infrastructure law yes I was going to talk a little bit about that but I can go ahead and address that now if you'd like to do you want to hear it now before we vote yeah yes please okay because item seven includes both items doesn't it just a question Amy did you in did you intend to separate those out to be two separate I did intend for them to be two separate decision items but if you'd like me to discuss the berson infrastructure law part before voting I'm happy to do that too does it affect your vote okay then let's let's act on the motion all those in favor of the motion to approve the SCP staff recommendations say I I and opposed okay that motion carries now we can talk about the conservation projects funded through bipartisan infrastructure law funds great uh thank you director fault so um as you all are aware there are a lot of various sources of federal funding available at at the moment um and as we've been working through system conservation pilot program we've noted that there might be some projects that don't fit squarely with an SC P um but might benefit from bipartisan infrastructure law funds and as you may recall the the B funds are really focused on things like measurement monitoring uh and and implementing the drought contingency plan and some of those projects might have water conservation components so we don't have any of those you know those types of projects that would include conservation components under contract in Colorado at this time but what we like to do is provide assurances for potential applicants or folks that might have projects fitting this category that they also would fit under the same statutory protections as scpp and we are happy to provide more information to the board as those projects develop um but but that's kind of the goal here okay other questions director sakata thank you yeah I would appreciate that because that I'm a little concerned again because of the transparency issue last time with scpp I just feel I don't know you know how they're going about recruiting for these projects what their timeline for these projects are anything like that it makes sense that it should be a conservation program so I'm not against that process but um just keeping us up to date about what what these are and how they're being reviewed and who's reviewing them I think would be important sure no we're very happy to do that and the other thing I'll note is that some of the projects funded by by bipartisan infrastructure law funds I think this board is uh familiar with um but you know might not be aware that you know they might be funded additionally by these funds like uh the you know I'm trying to think you know soil moisture type projects um Brian uh I'm I'm sorry I'm trying to I'm thinking about the projects that are being funded by bipartisan infrastructure law the types of projects stream gauges Eddie karian Towers thank you for coming up with all the words that I blanked on weather stations um but we'd be happy to provide a more comprehensive update of exactly what types of projects those are okay director R thank you Mr chair uh just for clarification Brian this would be the additional funding to maintain the Edie covariance Tower and gremling is that correct so director sakat I think that a lot of these as far as like the list of what was just made so you know this board approved that project way back when the funding is gone but in order to maintain now the Eddie coari Tower it's coming in so just whatever that's worth thank you yeah and I'll also note that I think some of these projects um you know we might need to go through the scpp process first to kind of Identify some of them that might not fall squarely with an scpp that might include a water conservation component so some of it might be a bit of a timing issue but um we're again happy to return and and let you all know what those are so is the definition of a conservation project Something That We're it's this seems a little circular like how who how will you determine if something is a conservation project and then would fall under the protections that we're preparing to afford it sure so I guess I'm thinking of this in terms of uh projects that uh involve a conserved consumptive use or uh you know some kind of enrollment of you know uh someone's historical water use so I think they'd be kind of similar in nature potentially to scpp projects but not fitting squarely within that framework are there other questions or is there a motion to oh yeah director Cloud so are you planning on having like several applicants or is this I mean so my understanding at this point is that most of the bipartisan infrastructure law funded projects will be more of what Brian was just talking about the Eddie karian Towers um things like that so I I don't want to be predecisional about this because it's you know without having seen the scpp applications for example it's hard to know exactly what types of projects would fit within this um I don't anticipate a lot is my two cents I don't anticipate this being a major uh program because you know in theory a lot of the conserve consumptive use projects should fit within scpp director Vasquez you said measuring and monitoring I don't know would soy moisture monitoring uh be included yes okay Y and what about lysimeter studies more of a stretch I think yeah just come up here Brian sorry focused on Ed covariance Towers which are similar and what they measure to limers um there are no lysimeters planned uh for this current funding that we have I asked because we have a project in North Park so curious sorry what was that we have a project in in the North Plat Basin yeah there are several limers around the state Rocky Ford North Park um yeah for sure okay any other questions on this one is there or is there a motion to um extend the conservation program designated conservation program protection to these types of projects as well director Vasquez okay director Cloud second any other discussion okay all those in favor of the motion say I I I and opposed motion carries yeah okay we'll move on to item 11 Colorado River updates all right uh thank you so much again for the record am otic with the interstate Federal and water information section and I'm here to give the Colorado River updates um just a few notes before I get started one is that um at this board's request we are no longer doing the extended hydrology update as part of this regular update there is information in your board memo and we're happy we as then Brian and Michelle are happy to answer any of the kind of technical hydrology related questions that you might have about any of that or I can try to do my best to um but just wanted to let you all know that if in the future you think it would be useful to reinstate that let us know and we're happy to do it and it may also make sense to do that you know maybe when the August 24mth study comes out for example so we can still do those at some interval just not at every board meeting um I also just wanted to say I am so thrilled that Michael Elizabeth stakus is on the team I know that that's already been mentioned but um it's already just been so great having her in the loop on all Colorado River things and having her expertise um and on a Communications related note I wanted to just remind you all of the communications toolkit that you have the Colorado River comms toolkit and let you know that we've done some updates to that with the more recent infographics and we'll continue updating that regularly um if you have any questions about accessing that or anything let me or Emily's Mac know um so I wanted to take the time today and I'll keep this pretty brief but I just wanted to give a quick overview of the varia NEPA processes that are ongoing on the Colorado River because there are a lot uh so the three that I I wanted to highlight are the near-term Colorado River operations the inum uh supplemental Eis on the the 2007 guidelines the Glen Canyon Dam long-term experimental and management plan supplemental Eis and finally the post 2026 process and you are all pretty familiar um with these to some extent but I know it can get confusing when we're talking about them interchangeably so just wanted to kind of highlight what they're all focused on and what the timeline is on each and kind of what we're up to in each of these categories so um the two that are more near term first uh the supplemental Eis for the 07 guidelines and I'm going to talk a little bit more about where we are in that process in just a moment but just a reminder that that's only through 2026 so that process is really just meant to supplement the current guidelines in place until they expire uh the Glen Canyon Dam long-term environmental and management plan so this is limited to the Lemp record of decision and one important thing to understand here is that this is really just limited to the hourly daily monthly operations at Glen Canyon Dam all of that is subject to the 07 guidelines so the annual releases from the 07 guidelines this has to operate within that and it's really the goal is to manage resources Downstream of Glen Canyon Dam so uh that is ongoing right now uh Colorado just provided a uh letter relating to the scoping process and just so you all know Michelle Garrison is the state's representative on the there are so many acronyms the Adaptive management work group for the L temp the amwi for the L temp uh so um um if you have any questions specific to that uh always feel free to reach out to Michelle she's very very knowledgeable about that program and finally the longer term process that we're engaged in the post 2026 negotiations and the the um uh Nea process for that and so you know anything that comes after the 07 guidelines the post 2026 operations that will also be the framework for whatever comes next for the L temp uh because again that you know LTM is subject to the 07 guidelines or or what comes after them so just wanted to give you a minute with that because again it can get really muddy and confusing with so many NEPA processes going on and really what our goal is at this time is just to make sure that we are adequately creating a record protecting Colorado's interests in Colorado River matters in these various contexts so that's really what we've been focused on uh but I want to take a moment and zoom in on the 2007 guidelines uh supplemental Eis process because we it's been a it turns out not that long of a road in terms of NEPA processes but it feels like it's been a long road because there have been a lot of uh turns in the road I guess so to speak um so just a reminder of where we've been on this the process was initiated because as you are all aware uh Lake Po and Lake me hit critically low levels and the Reclamation determined that more was needed to protect those reservoirs the 07 guidelines just weren't going to cut it so they initiated the process in January of 2023 Six States provided a consensus-based modeling approach uh presenting an option that that six of the states believed would uh could work to protect the system um April 2023 Reclamation released a draft supplemental e uh focusing on two Alternatives calling for cuts in the lower Basin States and I'm breezing through all this because I I know that I've briefed you on them before but just want to put where we are now in context uh May 2023 by that point things had um I guess changed in the world a little bit we got a bit of snow um and the lower division States provided a proposal to voluntarily conserve 3 million acre feet of water um at that time I think you know we heard a lot in the news about the historic color River agreement that the Basin States had reached and we were very clear to say actually the upper division States just requested that that analysis be or that proposal be analyzed more that we didn't have enough information to say yes we agree with this yes we think it's sufficient to protect the system so we simply requested an analysis of that and that brings us to where we are today uh with a revised draft supplemental environmental impact statement that was just released in October uh October 25th to be exact and I just want to provide a high level overview of what we're seeing in this uh revised draft scis the first thing is that there's a I think they I can't remember what they called it a letter to the reader that recognizes that the hydrology has really improved so Reclamation um essentially states that because of the improved hydrology you know things have shift shed a little bit and so we're now looking at things through that lens uh there is now one proposed alternative listed in the draft seis and that is the proposal to conserve 3 million acre feet the other two Alternatives that we saw in the last dcas are also included but they're in the section titled uh Alternatives considered but not analyzed in detail um and I want to caveat all this with you know the fact that this is a a really long and technically dense document so I don't want to get ahead of our technical team uh we have a lot of questions and a lot of analysis to do but just want to let you know kind of what it says at a high level so the proposed alternative assumes 3 million acre feet of lower Basin conservation through 2026 with one in a half million of that by the end of 2024 and this would be 2.3 million acre this would be compensated uh by uh federal funds um there's also a statement that some of this could include creation of intentionally created Surplus which is a tool that was created in the 07 guidelines and carried carried forward in the drought contingency plan whereby the lower Basin states have an ability to conserve water and Lake me for later use um so we have some questions about how that would work we have a lot of questions about how this would work uh so we are going to continue analyzing uh what we're seeing uh Brian and Michelle have been hard at work looking at all this uh we'll be talking with the other upper division States about what they're seeing um and comments are due on December 11th so those are the things that we'll be working through in the very near future um but you know what we continue to believe uh is that it's in all of our best interest to look uh farther into the future post 2026 operation I think you know looking at this DSis looking at everything that's happened in the last several years on the Colorado River really highlights that we just need to do better uh we just need better operational guidelines for Palam and so we've really been focused on getting the best deal next time around on that note um I did want to highlight that the bureau Reclamation recently posted a scoping report and an outline of the purpose and need for the Post 2026 guidelines so we are again looking at that and continuing to look at everything post 2026 through the lens of these uh irrefutable truth negotiating principles that commissioner Mitchell has set out um and making sure that really at every step of the way we're protecting Colorado's interest in this process so you all are again pretty familiar with these they are in your board Communications toolkit uh another quick update I'll provide here is that we've been working our way through all the Bas round tabls which has been really great and really focusing on talking about these you know how are people feeling about them what what input do people have and we've gotten a lot of really really great input uh so we'll continue that as we move forward and uh continue to get people's thoughts around the states as we move through the post 2026 negotiations and that's all I have for today thank you Amy um are there any questions for her no yes director sakata should I just Sor call on you after every item and then see if anyone has question no no thanks samie for that update so from from um my Farmer perspective then see if I am I understanding this right a lot of the focus and need for this um this interim guideline is be for the record so to speak I mean it it may essentially get us through the next two years what they're proposing but really it's important to put in the record to build on the future what we want to achieve is that kind of the bottom line yeah can I just are you I just want to clarify that I know what you're asking about are you talking about the supplemental C process right yeah that's correct I think you know we all have interest in ensuring that the um reservoirs don't syn to critically low levels and and exactly creating a record making sure that Colorado's interests are protected throughout that process great sorry I I think it isn't to me haven't been involved in Nea processes yes it's to make the record but it's also to influence the decision and you know that that is the process by which the the federal agency whoever is taking the lead on the federal action will receive feedback they are required perpa to at least consider that feedback they don't have to agree with it um but but it's an opportunity to hopefully influence the decision positively one more question I'm trying to find it and this question is probably not going to be clear either but there was a comment that I highlighted that one of the releases an L temp release they claim to have no authority to correct the inadvertent release so that's actually I'm glad I'm glad that you raised that you read our memos very carefully structor scata um so that is actually uh under the 07 guidelines there's an attempt to uh you know balance the reservoirs and sometimes because of forecast because you know Lake me because things that might be happening in the lower Basin um Lake me might be a little bit higher than they anticipated inflows into Lake Powell uh you know might not be what they expected and yeah turns out sometimes they release more water from Lake Powell than they actually should have questions I guess just one final one for me is um the two Alternatives that were in the supplemental draft you know the E that they started last spring have those those Alternatives have been shelved I mean they were sort of similar but to one another but seemed like they were perspective maybe a little more pointed you know had a little more um there was more behind them it seemed like than what's they've now seem to have just shifted to this California plan and maybe aren't um and aren't considering those other two is that right Fair assessment like I said the two Alternatives still appear in the you know considered but not analyzed in detail section um but yeah I I think that this signals that Reclamation is really focused on on this uh new proposal rather than those other two Alternatives okay of ourselves in terms of talking about performance um so I think we still have some work to do to really uh fully understand how this new alternative would operate we need to understand the assumptions behind it you know going back to that IC component we need to we need to understand it better to really have a clear understanding of how it would perform but I I think that all of your observations are very fair okay so is there any chance in influencing with your comments to include evaporative losses in transit in that consideration yeah that's a really great question director Vasquez I'm glad you brought it up so evaporation Transit losses um you know Reclamation has committed to uh conducting a study to look at what the evaporation Transit losses are in the lower Basin and um I think there are some that would say you know as long as there are 1.5 million acre feet of cuts in the lower Basin you you know call it what you want um Others May think it's important to call it out directly so I think that your I understand the point that you're making and we'll continue to push on the need for inclusion of evaporation and Transit losses in the lower Basin I'm not I can't speak to when and how exactly that'll happen or when the federal government will do that okay next up is item 12 Upper Colorado and San Juan recovery program updates with Cara sheal hello thank you uh for the record car sheal cwcb staff I serve as the endangered species program um excuse me endangered species recovery program manager this is agenda item 12 um an up an update on the upper Colorado and San Juan recovery programs um this is an information item only we thought that we might take the time today to um give this board a refresher on how this program operates and the benefits that it provides which might have um been well placed before Caleb's presentation but the um main purpose of today is to give you all an update on the reauthorization process that's going on right now for these important programs and hitting you pretty hard with this map of the Colorado Basin but um we're going to be talking about a little bit different aspect of that and that is our fish our fish friends who have occupied this River for the last three to five million years and specifically I am talking about these four species the Colorado pikem minnow the humpback chub the razor back sucker and the bonytail and historically these four fish have dominated the Colorado River Basin they are well equipped to handle the flashy uh desert rivers that are characteristic of much the Basin but over the last century due to drastic changes in their habitat the population of these species have declined to a point nearing Extinction an idea of some of the habitat changes I'm talking about pictured here is the San Juan River over um a 100 years apart and you can see the many drastic changes that have happened um you know most obvious is that the channel has narrowed and there's a lot more vegetation but much less obvious from the status static picture is the changes in flow regime that have happened because of Upstream reservoirs of human development and a change in climate changes have led to a decline in these species to a point where the US fish and wildlife service has listed them as federally endangered which means they are protected under The Endangered Species Act which was passed by Congress in 1973 and following the the passage of that act act that all federal agencies and any water project that has a federal Nexus needs to comply with the requirements of that act um in order to conserve and protect the endangered and threatened species and their habitats and due to the imperal um status of these fish in the Basin in 1983 the US fish and wildlife service proposed no further net depletions in the Upper Colorado River Basin was necessary to protect the endangered fish and this obviously POS was a great conflict in The Basin so in 1984 spurred by the Colorado water Congress the Upper Colorado Coordinating Committee was established to come up with a solution to this and the group was really focused on an overall question which is how do we meet the needs of these species and assist with their recovery on a programmatic level while also allowing water development in the Basin to continue for the well-being of the people who live and use this water so in 1988 that solution was established which is the Upper Colorado recovery program and then shortly after in 1992 the sister program just a little bit further south the San Juan recovery program was established programs were established by signing of a Cooperative agreement between federal state tribal and non-governmental agencies and they do exactly what that original group sought out to they work collaboratively to protect the endangered fish while still uh providing for the water needs of the community programs do so by focusing on these six elements of recovery they instream flow management habitat development and maintenance propagation and stocking non-native fish management research and monitoring and Outreach and education so I'm going to go into depth on what we do under each one of these categories so um first off instream flow management this is probably the most familiar to this group but the program augments flows through critical reaches of habitat for the endangered fish and we've worked really hard to secure firms um water or firm storage dedicated for use by the recovery program and this is done largely through partnership with the cwcb and utilization of our instream flow program to um to acquire this storage and then subsequently deliver and protect it through these critical reaches of habitat um we also work with other partners water providers energy producers irrigators to lease their water when it is available um this slide lists out the the number of storage pools that the recovery program most often uses Caleb did a really great job of going through um this the storage that we use on the Colorado River but we're also doing similar types of augmentation throughout the Basin um and it's quite heavy on information and I understand that but it's actually I think quite telling of how this process works because of the number of people and entities that are involved in collaborating um to get this water through these reaches of river for the protection of these species habitat loss and alteration the program is undertaking several activities that help to improve the quality and quantity of the habitat needed for recovery and different Tech techniques are used um to create a variety of habitat types that are important to these species like Backwater spawning habitats and floodplain Wetlands um spawning habitat is essential to the recovery of all these species um and we can improve on the availability and access to that spawning habitat um through projects like the one shown in the middle which is a fish ladder that was constructed on the Grand Valley project um that allows for fish passage past the roller Dam reconnecting habit uh reconnecting habitat like this is especially important for a highly migratory species like the Colorado Pik meno and the razor back sucker blood plane Wetlands like the one shown in the picture on the right are creating an increasingly important habitat type for these fish um currently we manage several flood plane sites on the Colorado and green rivers that have control structures that allow us to manage water levels to provide Nursery habitats mostly for Razer back sucker and bonytail the picture on the left shows some wild spawned young of year bony that were found in Stuart Lake this year which is one of those managed sites efforts exist on the upper Colorado and green Rivers for um Razorback sucker and for bonytail and then for pike minnow and Razer back sucker on the San Juan um River in the San Juan River basin there are five Hatchery facilities that exist throughout the Basin including one that's managed by CPW the Muma native aquatic species restoration facility in in alosa pration from non-native fish have played a role in the decline of these endangered fish um over time certain non-native species have successfully reproduced in the rivers and that many times are out producing the native fish this is often because these non-native species are better able to exploit The Wider range of environmental conditions that have resulted from altered habitat like truncated Peak flows and lower and warmer base flows among the most problematic are Walley smallmouth bass in Northern Pike in the Upper Colorado in green rivers and carp and channel catfish in the San Juan River program the program and program Partners have been spending an abundant amount of time on the mechanical removal of of these species um for example our partners at CPW conduct non-native removals on 105 miles of river in the Yampa white Colorado and Gunnison um removal has had variable success Northern Pikes seem to be seem to have been meaningfully reduced um in the gampa where there are once a dominant species however small mouth bass on the other hand still remain a dominant species on many of the rivers um they thrive in that clear warm flows that result as as part of drought and have high reproductive rates so it is unlikely that we will be able to um control these populations o only with mechanical removal however the program has had a great success recently with supplementing the removal with um our managed stream flows that will help to disrupt the Smallmouth bath reproduction the program is also combating natives with eliminating in River spawning habitats um screening off ponds and reservoirs to prevent escapement and then identifying sources of non-natives the picture on the left shows a newly installed screen on Ridgeway Reservoir that the cwcb contrib contributed $1 million towards in um 2021 monitoring are essential components of our management that help to inform all the other recovery elements research helps us test out the effectiveness of our management and monitoring is performed to track the species status and their Trends juveniles and adults are implanted with tags and then tracked throughout the system and here I've included a couple pictures of myself having one of the best days of my um in my career so far out helping with some of these efforts uh we got a risey back sucker in a pike minnow that day integral to all of these elements we are working hard to spread the good word about the recovery programs um we work to build collaborative relationships throughout the Basin and the recovery program is also working with CPW on several of these efforts CPW um hosts different non-native uh fish fishing tournaments throughout the Basin um here's a couple of Lucky winners that have uh won a prize for catching the most smallmouth bass out of elkhead reservoir um the cwcb also contributes towards the prize money of these tournaments and they have been extremely successful on being able to remove these non-native species as well of spread awareness about their effects successful implementation of all these elements the program is in turn able to provide streamlined Endangered Species Act compliance for over 1,500 water projects in Colorado and importantly since the initiation of these recovery programs no water project in the Upper Colorado Basin has been halted because of Endangered Species Act compliance for the listed fish nor have any lawsuits been filed challenging The Endangered Species Act compliance facilitated by the recovery programs wondering how these fish are doing the humpback chub currently resides in five stable populations four in Upper Colorado and then one large complex in the Grand Canyon these populations have exhibited resiliency by naturally completing all life stages they cover a broad Geographic extent and are genetically diverse for these reasons in October 2021 the US fish and wildlife service reclassified the humpback chub from endangered to threatened the Colorado Pike minnow is still listed as endangered there are two remaining naturally recruiting populations in the Green River in the Colorado River as well as a third population in the San Juan River that's supplemented through stocking efforts it's the rarest of the species um stocking has occurred across this this species historic range but less than 1% of the stock bone tail have been recaptured in the wild so we continue to learn about um this species needs to continually improve on our stocking efforts for them the Razer back sucker were functionally extrap from the upper Basin in 2000 but due to the program stocking efforts they have become a s a story of success evaluation of the Hatchery produced Razer back suckers um indicates that they are surviving spawning and producing larvea in the wild and a wild razor back sucker was documented in the Green River in 2020 which is the first time since the species was extrap from the upper Basin this indicates that the recovery programs can reestablish conditions that are capable of supporting entire life cycles of the species that was previously close to extinction because of these successes the Razer back sucker has also been um recommended to be reclassified from endangered to threaten and that is currently under review and we expect that to come back later this year in your Mo I provided um an update um on an item that this group has been working very hard on the last couple of years and that starts with a new funding structure so due to the impacts on the reliability of hydropower funding the partners were forced to look at a new um funding structure for these incredibly important programs um the partners have recommended an increase in annual funding for both the upper Colorado and San Juan programs funding the Upper Colorado at 9.7 million and the San Juan at 4.21 million and this would be a cost share between Federal and non-federal partners with the states um slowly increasing their contributions in in fiscal year 2029 the good news is that we as a state um already have this funding set aside for our anticipated contributions um this board approved a request for Appropriations in November of 2022 um that funding was reviewed by the legislature and signed into law June of this year in the 2023 cwcb projects Bill the federal side the current authorization for these programs ends in September of 2024 the program Partners have been working hard with our federal delegation on the reauthorization of these programs and currently we have two bills that have been introduced into Congress on the state side excuse me on the Senate side we have Senate Bill 2247 which was introduced by Senator Hickenlooper with the help of Senator Romney um staff at cwcb and at DNR has been working very closely with Senator hickenlooper's staff on the language of this bill and so some key highlights from this um it would reauthorize the program for seven years through fiscal year 2031 um and importantly it supports the increase in annual funding that was recommended by the partners um as well as adds additional authorizations to the capital projects Bill excuse me capital projects Budget on the house side house representative um bober introduced HR 4596 which mirrors many of the same attributes however the major difference between these two bills is the amount of annual funding that's authorized in the house version and this is due to the current rules that are in place at the house known as payo so it um limits the funding levels to what was previously already authorized meaning it would maintain the amount of funding that we're receiving right now and um both bills were heard by their representative committees earlier this year um HR 4596 passed out of committee in September um meaning that it could go to vote on the house floor at any time perspective it's critical to continue to stress the importance of increased funding for these programs um the authorized annual funding has not increased since 2019 despite a 19% inflation and I know that many of you in this room can sympathize with that but the program is looking at um having to make some crucial cuts to to the activities that there already doing um under under the a maintained funding level which um in these activ support endangered species acts compliance for many projects throughout the Basin so from our conversations with the Congressional staff it's likely that there will be some negotiations between the House and Senate sides to reconcile the amount of funding um when this will happen is is unclear still at this time but from indications from congressional staff um it seems like it is most likely that some sort of reauthorization May pass with the Omnibus um spending bill later this year and again that is you know totally a guess but um that is how things have been trending lately in Congress um I just wanted to thank this board for your continued support for these programs um they are extremely um important to the Basin so thank you happy to take any questions thank you cara are there questions for her thanks Cara for that uh thorough brief I'm curious when you're trying to recover a species from zero like the Razer back um how do you ensure genetic diversity they yeah that's a great question Dr Vasquez and and I have to caveat this with I'm not a biologist I'm just a lowly engineer so I will do my best to answer it but um they started collecting The Brood stock for the Razer back sucker many many years before they were extrated just to increase that genetic diversity please don't denigrate Engineers I'm both a biochemist and an engineer so I can root for both sides of that um Mr chairman um U because of the the legal status of you either you know threatened or endangered um do you have to you know Monitor and do electros shcking annually or a couple times a year to really look at where the population levels like yes um that is done continuously actually so we have crews out there all summer long that are doing electroshocking and um collecting samples and um we also have a lot of um antennas that are out um in the rivers that are collecting data at any time and then that species assessment is done on a five-year basis so all that data goes into the assessment of that you know it looks like um you know hopefully um Congress will pass a budget or at least a continuing resolution and um you know since this is a multi-year funding project I assume if there is a federal government shutdown this shouldn't have an impact on you or this program right away or anything right because we're what I can't remember for the authorization we're a couple years into it yes so um I won't promise to be an expert on this either but um current authorizations go through September of 2024 so we are we are authorized do have funding through September of 2024 here thank you car thanks for the update also I was amazed attending some of the conferences on the west slope that when Julie was presenting how they're adjusting flows out of reservoirs for the spawn times of spawning I think you briefly mentioned that that was really critical whether yeah to for the species that you're trying to support at the right time but also for those invasive species to actually wash them away or or make make it so they're not reading as quickly so amazing work that's been going on thank you yeah and you know as we continue to learn and better our management I think things like that come up director sakata where we've learned that we can uh get the most bang for our buck out of the water that we do have all right thanks Cara thank you okay next we have item 13 which is a request for authorization to proceed to trial an opposition case number 21 CW 3085 and 21 CW 3086 in Water Division 5 thank you chairman felt uh for the record Colin Watson streaman Lake protection section uh this is an action item uh I am staff is seeking authorization to proceed to trial in two related cases in division 5 uh 21 CW 3085 and 3086 uh cwcb is an opposer in both of these cases uh the applicant is Elk Run Ranch uh and others and a three-day a trial has been set to begin December 11th in Aspen which I didn't know there were trials in Aspen but I know now uh staff are preparing to participate uh in order to protect various instream flow water rights um the applications uh they they kind of go together one of them's for a pond storage system uh the other one's for an augmentation plan uh to augment out of priority depletions associated with that system uh there's also a potential implication of senior irrigation water rights and their use um on the property which is one of the reasons that that we're involved in the case um there has been as uh Jen melee pointed out there has been some recent motions in the case uh on that issue uh there are other opposers remaining in the case currently as well um this is a overview map of the applicants property and the instream flow water rights in the area and um I'd be happy to answer any questions if if anyone wanted more background information on the case I'll proceed to the author uh staff recommendation um this recommendation uh sometimes I present on authorization to proceed to in stipulated cases we haven't stipulated in this case yet but as you can see in the recommendation it kind of rolls that other recommendation into it uh where we're seeking authorization to defend a stipulation at trial if we do settle if that is necessary okay is there a motion to director bue thanks Mr chair um I would move staff recommendation on agenda item 13A okay second from director Colmes auction move there okay okay so we have a motion in a second to approve staff recommendation all those in favor say I I opposed motion carries thank you for your time thanks Colin and item 14 notice of 2024 instream flow and natural lake level recommendation amended Appropriations in water divisions 1 two 4 and six thank you for the record Brandy Logan cwcb staff uh you just said the agenda item but yes notice of instream flow recommendations divisions 1 two four and six uh this is not an action item this is just part of our notice procedure Pro the rules so see if I can advance this oh that shows each of your basins and I wanted to briefly go through the nine recommended stream reaches and the one recommended Lake that you may be asked to take action on at the January 2024 board meeting in division one we have uh two CPW recommendations one is Williams Gulch which is a tributary to the cash lauta River and the other is square Toops Creek which is in the headwaters of the North Fork of the South flat both of these are locations where CPW has been doing extensive work for a number of years in order to um introduce green back cutthroat trout in an effort to increase the number of sustainable populations in the state moving to division six or sorry to division four we have two more CPW recommendations East and West Muddy Creek which are located above ponia Reservoir these uh cpdf recommendations are to protect a mixture of cold water fish like sculpin and trout as well as a Remnant population of bluehead Sockers uh moving over we have Spain Gulch and Deer Creek which are tributaries to the East River Basin near crusted but these are both recommendations from High Country conservation Advocates to protect brick trout fisheries and then on the west side of uh division 4 we have North lobe Creek which is a tributary to the Dolores River Basin this is a BLM recommendation for rainbow trout and uh brown trout moving to division six we have way G which is a tributary to Willow Creek below Steamboat Lake um that has Mountain native Mountain suckers and then in Jackson County we have wheeler Creek uh which supports a small brook trout fishery finally in division two we have a recommendation for a Titan Lake this is to protect Boreal toads these are a state endangered amphibian species CPW has recently translocated this species into Titan leak in an effort to establish some additional populations just showing an overview of the process for new instream flow recommendations over the last year staff has been in this phase of analysis and public Outreach we've been reviewing the recommendations and the supporting data we have visited each of these locations and we're currently finalizing the water availability assessments uh and the flow rates and preparing the executive summaries ahead of the January meeting um per rural instream flow 5c we have also provided notice to the instream flow Subs subscription mailing list this was done back in March and again on Monday of this week and staff has also been conducting a number of Outreach efforts including County Commissioner presentations meetings with other interested parties uh we're sending letters out to adjacent land owners to inform them and we'll be publishing notices of these recommendations in local newspapers to provide further opportunities for those who haven't heard about these recommendations through some other means to uh what will happen in January so the recommendations that we're prepared to bring forward will come to you at the January 2024 be board meeting that kind of kicks off your decision process and hearing process you may choose to uh form your intent to appropriate rights in January if so then there'll be an opportunity for public comment in March and then final action in May unless a hearing is necessary that's all the information I have on this item um there is no need for action but I can take any questions okay are there questions yes director vasque I just want to publicly thank you for inviting me on the trip to Wheeler Creek it certainly gives me a perspective on the scrambling that you do to validate all of these proposals that was a nice out day out in the field I'm glad that that worked out for you to join us um just a question I have is in my memory from the materials in the agenda packet which I can't seem to open up right now but um the map in that packet made it made me wonder if Titan Lake was actually in Lake County or might be in Eagle or Summit counties I I hope our GIS is working correctly I think we we think it's inivision two we will double check and get back to you okay sakata has it the map that was provided and yeah so it's a on the picture it's a fairway into um we're not at the action point yet but I guess just if you might just want to check it may just be the map was it it could issue we'll take a look okay great yeah any other questions this one okay thank you thank you Brandy amazing how we do that you get all the credit yeah way to go Mr chair good job I feel like one of The Incredibles or something going so fast you can't even see us superow it's time for our afternoon break almost um so go ahead and do that this is a 15minute break so we'll just we'll come back at 3:25 somehow you're one minute early I know we're going to resume with item 15 Financial matters and just as a reminder in addition to a b and c we're adding consent AG consent agenda item number six um Kirk Russell Finance Section Chief and before I get started I wanted to voice my disappointment in you chairman pH um those of you at the finance committee uh witnessed that uh you were entrusted with a yellow flag and you had an opportunity at the beginning of this meeting when director riss announced that assistant or deputy director Moss announced that Cole Bedford was stolen from Team finance and in my Arena that warrants an unsportsmanlike conduct so I'm trying to compose myself in my frustration on the sideline here but [Laughter] uh all right very good I do have it with me and just so you know Kirk I've been carrying it with me to my commissioner meetings as well yeah it's effective it gets the attention yeah that's good all right so uh agenda item 15a is the routine financial matters report and I wanted to uh introduce Mimi winter she's the finance manager of the Loan program and she is the one that provides me these numbers and I Consolidated into the way I presented the board so thank you for work she was an excellent addition to the staff um and we'll talk the next agenda item about the Clifton lson Financial compilation that she was instrumental in getting num and I cons at the bottom of that memo I try to do this in the September meeting sometimes the numbers aren't available but I like to point out it's a very very high level and I'm already high level when I talk about the handouts that I give you but this is even another level and it allows me um to track how we're moving through the year our initial projections when it comes to I talk in brand new money the money that we it's Revenue we have a revolving Loan program so the principal continues to rotate in and out but I talk about the brand new $100 bills that we get through our borrowers and the Investments that we have and federal Min Rel lease and service tax so I tried to point out at the bottom there where we started with our assumption that First Column the 27.9 and then down and I just wanted to highlight in this particular table that I'm showing that we're actually expecting a little bit more interest here than last year interest rates at treasury have gone up and that's seeing an impact as that money sits in our account before it goes out to our borrowers and I just wanted to highlight today's is the far right the other one I wanted to point out so the sance tax that 50 $50 million under current projections that that might come down a little bit based on some new numbers that I've seen and some uh changes that are being made so again that's I just wanted to highlight that's what that is it helps me keep track of where we are as well so now I want to move to the handout and just highlight a couple items that um are of note we continue to move through that projections column uh you see the 65.2 million in row 10 it's a obviously a large number that is the recommended staff recommended loan increase for chimney Hollow for Northern Colorado that you'll hear tomorrow Cole Bedford will be presenting that and then those fives underneath that in row 11 12 and 13 I just spread out what I see as extra available in order to hit my target down at the bottom so I show that we have about 13 million I'm sorry $15 million available uh for the remainder of this fiscal year for the next three board meetings error on row 19 that cwcb NRI projects budget I have a 12 in there that actually should be 14 I forgot to include the staff's recommendation coming up here for a Turf replacement that you'll hear uh Jenna Batson present as part of the non-reimbursable projects Bill item so that was a slight change on that one moving to the severance tax Perpetual base nothing surprising changing there the uh you see the threes lined up for the next three board meetings so I've got 9 million and when I say that um that that is the most conservative approach to the way we operate if we had to go below zero in these in these funds we know that there's plenty of time to catch up and with all the projections that we deal with but that uh to add those two funds together we have about $22 million available for the next two board meetings for new loans number 17 in that s tax that 3 million would be agenda item 18 that will'll uh be coming up yet this afternoon you can see line 19 down at the bottom under projections that number was 40 million when we were talking at uh at September in the finance committee meeting I've dropped that to zero um because of some changes with uh with Severance tax and budget issues and so the third page which I don't routinely provide to the board it is a summary of it's that model that I use to look out years I have projections that are out years they're not as good as the current year projections but we look at just uh consistent numbers routine um routines things like that and so the first two columns the construction fund and the severance tax those really are just shrunk down lines from that those first two pages I provide and it gives me an a way to look at where we're going to pull funds out for certain activities whether they be non- reimbursables or uh future loans and so I think I've shared with this board that we're looking at probably 20 to $25 million available each year for non- reimbursables I'm still going to stay consistent with that based on the model I use and that would be showing up on line 10 under construction fund and line 27 under construction fund but you can also see that as it exists today we've we have about 90 million available next year for new loans and 70 million in the following fiscal year so and we we typically say we do $50 million a year so we're in good shape everything looks good and I'd be happy to answer any questions all right great report are there questions for Kirk item take that as a no I was waiting for director sakata to oh signal me I'm getting conditioned I guess we can move on moving on agenda item 15b is uh the annual report to the board of our financial compilation as I mentioned earlier Mimi Winters is involved or Mimi winter is involved with the uh the Clifton Allen or Clifton Larson Allen Group and they come in and they look under the hood and make sure that we're doing things or reporting the things the way we're supposed to and those reports are included in here more for record than anything everything seems to be fairly consistent um from past years no surprises and uh we're happy to answer questions I uh Mimi had asked if we should have Clifton join us and I just felt like over the years there just wasn't enough questions to justify the participation so with that I would be happy to answer any questions and this is also a non-action item so any questions on the audit I guess you'd call it looks good moving on agenda item 15 C is also has become a routine item for this board um I am reporting on Two Rivers Water farming company and two rivers Farms F2 Inc loan delinquency and I wanted to share with the board that uh we move forward in uh sending out a notice the 1 of September we see we met in September and I shared with the that we sent that out in mid October when we were reviewing to send a letter calling that U that note due and full because we did not get a response from them we sent out 11 certified mail the Attorney General's officer said be conservative notify anybody and everybody that you have on record even though you know they're not existing there anymore but we sent all that out we did get two responses back from certified mail the problem was we had an error on our uh statement of what they owed on March 1st it was a typo was my fault and the Attorney General's office said let's just be conservative here again send them send it out corrected and so we did that so they're going to get 11 more uh certified mail sent out and so that uh that clock then just reset it was a 30-day clock started again around the 1 of October and we'll we'll give another 30 days so in uh when we see each other again in January Ary we'll have an update to that and uh really the the biggest impact of that delay is um starting the 7% interest that clock starts on a 7% interest rate so it's not a significant impact from a 30-day 30 45 day delay so we will uh continue to report to the board what our next steps are we do have Deanna Westfall with the Attorney General's office that has been working with Jen and I on how this plays out there is can't be more complicated and it seems like the deeper that uh we get involved in this organization and the complexities of all the other activities they have the different bankruptcies and uh filings and uh lawsuits that are flying around and the investors um we do I will share with this board that I feel somewhat protected in this board should feel protected in that the amount of money behind us is much much larger it's tenfold of the uh the debt that um is due to us and so there's a lot more money being uh applied to taking care of business that would protect us ultimately we have to find a buyer for this if it does go to foreclosure but uh the board will be um best act probably recommendations from the attorney Attorney General's office as well so with that I'd be happy to answer any questions uh I have a question I guess did the corrected number go up or down down it was uh the actual issue was we did this once before I don't know if you remember uh two or three years ago and that was a number that just did not get updated to the single payment it was still in there as a double payment so gotcha um I think it was wise for us to to replace that and do it again it's just 11 certified male documents going out the door and then 11 return envelopes that say can't be delivered is kind of a healthy stack on the desk but we did move forward okay are there other questions for Kirk on this one and that's my exit yep director sakata Kurt thank you Mr chair sorry um I'm a little slow today going back to 15a um what we were talking I talk to you briefly about the gauge fund under the statute I was you know I was looking through our statutes over the weekend and I found something called the stage the gauge fund and you were saying you thought that was taken out on what line 17 was is that cwcb operations or where does that get taken out of or is that something totally different I'm gonna have you director Sak I'm gonna have you pause that question it's agenda item number 17 we'll talk about it during the uh non- Reimers presentation perfect thank you thank you Kurt all right yep so Cole you got consent agenda item six for the record Co pedford cwcb staff um and before I start I want to thank everyone for everyone's comments today I'm really excited about the new role and uh really proud for everybody's trust and I really appreciate director R's comments this morning as she was talking I was found myself wishing that the bar were set lower for the new position if I was coming in and the my predecessor had been terrible that would have been much easier and uh every all the comments say no one has said thank God we're getting rid of Anna um and so you know I just want to thank her for everything she's done with the operations group and the work that they do and it's often thankless work and uh I'm just really excited to work with them and uh Kirk can rest easy that I'm not going far enough away to stop being a problem for him so I'll just be down the hall uh so this is uh agenda item consent agenda item 6A uh and uh we put it on the consent agenda originally because not to give it away but it's a fairly modest change to policy number four but it is a policy change and uh it's a change to the way we do some of our uh Financial calculations that you see in the memos um that the loan program gives you and so just to back kind of way out you know fundamentally The Loan program provides loans for what infrastructure projects and that Enterprise just involves some inherent risk and so we most of what what the Loan program does is spend our time reducing that risk so all the PMS are uh Professional Engineers we go out to project sites and meet owners and we talk to uh consultants and engineers and we walk alignments and um we look at water rights and we consolidate all of that information into memos that we provide to this board every board meeting and they look like this and the last thing on every one of these board memos is a table of financial ratios and there are two versions of that table depending on whether the borrower is a municipal type borrower or an agricultural type borrower and so for the municipals they look like this there are five ratios on each and so this is for the for Pueblo water we did a loan to them in March of 23 and the first three rows on here are these kind of standard ratios that you would see for any kind of loan it doesn't have to be a water project commercial Banks use these same ratios so as operating Debt Service and current assets and those r ratios um shouldn't change with time you know it doesn't matter what year it is your revenues should exceed your expenses and so then the last two ratios here are specific to The Loan program so we look at debt per tap so how much debt for every tap in the organization and then uh what's the average monthly water bill for the organization so this table looks like this for every single uh Municipal type borrower that we take to you and then there's a very similar one for agricultural borrowers the first three ratios are the same ones the standard ones for any loan anywhere and then the last one is this annual operating cost per acre foot and that's really specific to agricultural type borrowers and that would change with time a little bit this is uh the table from Fort Morgan resor and irrigation company in January tables and the um categories of weak average and strong are set by policy number four and that policy was set in 1999 um there was an audit in the mid and late 90s to The Loan program that has set most of our policies that we use now and it just kind of formalized a lot of what the organization does and so it set all six of those ratios it set the the first three that are regular ones and then the last three here the debt per tap and average monthly water bill for municipal types and then annual operating costs per acre foot for agricultural types the problem with that is those are fixed numbers that since 1999 very reasonably may have changed um but in the last quarter of a century we haven't gone back to look at how that's changed and even though we haven't we haven't had problems within the program so it's this has been a process we've been kind of looking at for a year kind of um to cover ourselves make sure we understand what we're doing but it hadn't really manifested in US seeing a lot of loans not working out the two rivers project notwithstanding to do let me go back just one so what we decided to do was to update those three ratios to use upto-date data to look at the kinds of organizations that come into our Loan program for loans and update the weak average and strong ratios to reflect what Colorado water users look like in 2023 so the very first one of those we did was debt per tap and so Dola and cdph both collect data on uh debt for municipal type organiz ations and the number of TAPS per organizations in Colorado and there were 127 out of two different studies in 1999 sorry in 2019 that represented organizations that might come into the Loan program for a loan and so this graph shows all 127 of those and how much debt they have each line represents one organization so here's peblo uh kind of on the strong end their debt per tap is pretty low that came in in March um the lowest on this list is the town of sance we don't have a loan with them but they could very potentially come in for a loan with us and then not to throw anyone under the bus but the high on here is the town of Wiggins with 16,000 and reasonably Wiggins is doing a lot of development they're on the edge of the kind of the uh Front Range growth and they're making Investments so we looked at all of these um to this is representative organizations that would come in in 2023 and the current breakdown for our ratios look like this so if all 127 of these organizations came in today everyone on the left we would call strong those organizations whose debt per tap is less than $2,500 we would call average just that narrow strip there and then weak would be the folks on the most right and so that's not very intuitive um if we said someone was strong it doesn't necessarily mean that they're strong re um relative to other organizations in the state right now so our recommendation is to change this to something like this here so strong would be folks under $300 debt per tap weak would be over $3,500 per tap and then the folks in the middle we'd call typical instead of average and so that's uh 15% on either side is weak and strong and then uh 70% in the middle is typical it's monthly water bill so DOA collected information in 2021 they had 117 Municipal type organizations and these are those 117 each line represents one of them uh Pueblo water is right here kind of on the strong side again the strongest is the town of antonito down by the New Mexico border and then the weakest here is Dominion water and sanitation and again that makes sense being in the Front Range and affluent neighborhood so our current ratios for average monthly water bill make a little bit more sense than uh debt per tap strong is under $30 weak is over $60 and so our recommendation is to shift sh just a little bit on this one keep strong at 30 weak over 90 and then typical everything in the middle and that's still 15% 15% in 70 then the last one we looked at was operating cost per acre foot and that data is not publicly available it's not collected by any state organization so we uh hired westwater research to find this information for us they reached out to organizations all over the state some of them were folks we've done loans with some of them were not they tried to get a representative sample of every agricultural type organization that might come into us and so on this graph um Fort Morgan resor irrigation company who we provide a loan to in January is uh fairly strong at about $2 the strongest one on here is a small ditch company in division 4 and for this data because a lot of them were private entities we scrubbed some of the identifying information we tried to provide enough to give some context so a small ditch company is under a th000 Acres of irrigated acreage and then it's in division four to kind of get a sense of what that is and then the most expensive on this is julsburg Irrigation District of public entity so our current operating cost per acre foot ratios would break down this way $10 and below is strong $20 and up is weak and average in the middle we're recommending a change to this under $3 strong over 24 weak and typical in the middle summary of what policy number four looks like with those changes so operating ratio debt service coverage ratio and annual cost breaker I'm sorry and cash reserves to expenses that will stay the same we'll change the name in the middle from average to typical just to give a sense that doesn't necessarily statistically mean that an organization is average and then we'll update debt per tap annual cost per acre foot and monthly water bill check uh what we did is we went back and we looked at the last 42 loan recommendations we made to the board and applied these new ratio recommendations to get a sense of had we applied these ratios to these loans what what would that have meant for our uh recommendations to you and there were pretty small changes and all of the changes were either from weak to typical or strong to typical and so you know average monthly water bill out of the last 12 Municipal type borrowers that we provided to you one of them would have been upgraded from weak to typical none of them would have been downgraded uh debt per tap about a third four out of 12 would have been changed from strong to typical and then on annual operating cost breaker foot you would have had a one change um from weak to typical and nine can't see it there but that's about a third of them uh downgraded from strong to typical so it would have changed some of the ratios but it would would not have changed any of our recommendations to you you know part of this is the ratios are just there for uh kind of a red flag to us you know we look at someone's uh financials something jumps out to us something's weak is there some explanation here it serves as a red flag for us and red flag for you to kind of gut check us staff recommendation here is just a small change to policy number four as I say and um pretty modest but but it gives us a better sense of these numbers are coming from and and hopefully gives you a better sense as Wells for Cole director sakata thank you Mr chair thanks Cole and um I really appreciate all the in-depth analysis you did on this it was really interesting to read through the packet um oh let's see one question and one comment uh I guess the question would be I thought I read in there too that if it is if there is a higher risk um that you can can you make a requirement that they adjust their fee structure or whatever yes absolutely yeah so if an organization comes in for a loan and you know it looks like their rates are too low to make their repayment we can require as part of the contract that they raise those rates great and then again I appreciated all the data that you collected there because at first I was going to assume that you know the debt ratios were going to be Associated to like size of the community or something and it well it looked pretty random to me yeah we were really interested to see that too I particularly in the operating cost per acre foot one I really thought that there was going to be a correlation between you know really big organizations there might be some efficiencies of scale very small entities that wouldn't be the case and it did seem random and and so then going to the acre foot one did you ever consider instead of a ratio to acre feet to acres serviced when we first started this process we had some conversations about whether we wanted to add some indicator ratios or change the ones we have and that kind of change is still on the table we might make a recommendation like that this particular process was a little felt more urgent yeah um there was a clear process for doing it uh and it was updating what we're doing now so something like that may very well be in the future because the reason I asked that I thought it was great information it started to get me to think about our ditch systems and to look at what what that ratio would be and in some ways it was hard because deliveries of acre feet each year was different you know because it depended on the water year so I was thinking well acreage stays constant and so yeah yeah absolutely and and that ratio in particular all the ratios really are just an indicator you know it gives us a sense of how things are but but that one in particular requires a little bit of an art to get a sense of because some organizations have a lot of augmentation water that may not be reflected in their cost it be a little bit different and so yeah we we do look pretty close at that what what that numers really telling us and for any of this data did you do any geographical analysis we did not because I thought that would be interesting too to see where the ratios if ratios were different geographically yeah and on on the operating cost per acre foot I thought there was going to be a correlation in districts as well I was really confident before I looked at it that district one was going to pop out as being more expensive and that wasn't necessarily the case either that was I really appreciate it thank you Mr chair y director Vasquez yeah if it's not confidential would it be possible to have uh just the spreadsheet version of your graphs uh sent out to the directors I think it might be interesting to be able to look at all the different entities that are represented there yeah absolutely Vasquez all right all those in favor say I and oppos motion carries thank you Cole you and I guess you might want to stay put it looks like so we'll go to item 16 which is Water Project loans yeah Cole Bedford cwcb staff uh this is agenda item 16a it is water project loan request for the measurement structure reconstruction project coming from the last chance ditch company in Weld County on this loan uh it's in division one the title is the measurement structure reconstruction project and the borrowers the last chance ditch company the requested loan amount is $7,990 uh for a 30-year term at a rate of 4.5% and that that's a little higher than most of our loans uh Last Chance has a pretty good percentage of commercial entities in their shareholder list uh in putting together the review of this loan application I worked with Garrett Vera who's the company president and I also worked with uh Dan Grant Brandon effland and Ryan cook it shows where this project is at you pass right by it on I25 as you uh pass St brain State Park uh the company has a diversion structure on the St brain Creek on the left side uh the ditch winds about a quarter of a mile through the park and the campground and then passes through the Flume that's the subject of this project and then passes under the interstate of that Flo uh on the left you can see that the water's flowing full through it and for it to be accurate there should be a little bit more of a fall there that suggests that the elevation should be raised right you can see that there's some scour occurring around the back back side and the edges of the FL so the vision here is just to replace this FL uh the steel structure with a concrete structure so the project the total project cost is estimated at $196,000 the loan will cover the entire project cost so with the one% service fee the loan amount will be 197,000 $960 for our standard 30-year term the last chance ditch company qualifies for blend rate of 4 a half% the financial ratios indicate that the company is a strong borrower uh and that would be the same even if we were using the new ratios and the collateral on this will consist of a pledge of revenues backed by a rate Covenant per policy number five and here is the staff recommendation I I don't believe we've got any uh company Representatives today so oh we got Garrett all right well Garrett or I can answer any questions okay do we have any questions on the proposal or the staff recommendation director I have a question that maybe I should have asked uh months ago in these presentations there's no down payment required in these loans no um the way we do the dispersals the uh will contract the project assuming it gets approved um and then we disperse funds during the construction phase most of the time that means once a month and then when the project closes out there is some interest accured during that period uh usually it's pretty small relative to the total amount of the project cost and then the first payment the actual payment on the loan is due a year after the construction is finished it does answer my question it just seems a little um different than most loans I'm familiar with and that's just because I'm not a big borrower so well and I mean isn't it true that many of these loans the borrower isn't borrowing all the money oftentimes the loan approval is a little bit above what the actual construction cost is at the end of the day um they leave a little bit on the table that makes it easy when we get to the end that we don't have to come back for an increase and a change to the contract chance to tell you all very thank you very much this program has been extremely important this is the second loan for the last chance ditch company in about 11 years uh right before the flood we replaced the river headgate and now about 11 years later we're here to replace The Flume just Downstream um and the reason why it is important is uh it goes to the heart of the question you were asking it this loan program allows uh potentially strapped for cash ditch companies to have an answer to a a problem such as replacing a flume before we receive orders from The Division office uh next next running season um so that's that's a big part of why at least for a mutual ditch company why this this loan program is is so great because it doesn't require a down payment um but it does allow us to have access to the money while still you know having having some skin in the game and paying paying the state back eventually can we get your name for the record sorry my name is Garrett Vara president of the last chance ditch company thank you any other questions for Garrett director sakata thank you Mr chair thanks Garrett for coming um to build on Garrett's Point too is Ditch companies we don't have a lot of collateral that you can go to a normal loaning entity to go get a loan so that's why these are also very important but I just wanted to publicly thank Garrett he has been a key person on the south plat Round Table uh he's been former chair of the South plat faing round table and currently and at the same time was serving on the uh um the grant program um committee and still serves in that capacity and he has done so much for so thanks thanks Garrett for all that you do there happy to do it on this one to move approval of Staff recommendation for agenda item 16a okay second from director Bret all those in favor say I iose okay motion carries thank you section chief I wanted to brag on Cole a little bit before his last presentation is a finance actually I you do have a couple more tomorrow but um you know watching Cole present the the uh those ratios and it it was kind of a last minute thing he pulled that together um I swear Cole could probably teach me uh calculus 3 better than I received in college he's just he's just a great great guy hard worker always wanting to do more and figure out ways to do things better and he'll do an incredible job um in his new role as coo and some of the board may not know this but Anna Moss was in the finance section she was promoted so this uh this position tends to be a strong one uh you probably have met Jonathan Hernandez he was in that role he's now managing 106 no $700 million Whitney chimney Hollow project um anyway it uh it disa breaks my heart that Cole's leaving us he he is a uh he's going to be right down the hall and he'll continue to help us do what we do and do it better and so um good congratulations Cole and uh good luck to you with that I'll uh have Joshua jump up all right Thank you Kirk and thank you Cole um so I guess a year and a half in I'm now the senior PM I appreciate that way you go all right uh good afternoon my name is Joshua Godwin cdb CB staff uh this is agenda item 16b water project loan request for the Beaver Creek ditch repairs for montazuma Valley irrigation company in Mont County uh monuma Valley irrigation company has been delivering water in the southwest Basin since 1880 and supplies roughly 125,000 acre feet on an annual basis to over 1500 shareholders the Beaver Creek ditch flows directly into groundhog Reservoir the largest of company's three reservoirs and has a capacity of 150 CFS uh the load amount for the ditch repair is $1,414 th000 and the terms are 30 years at a 2.1 % Blended interest rate my contact in preparing the board memo has been Brandon Johnson the general manager for the companyes on here as I could a lot has happened in a couple months uh on May 9th of this year uh two wash outs were discovered in the beaver uh Creek ditch the first was about 30 feet long 40 feet wide and 20 feet deep the second extended about 2,000 ft uh long and created a ravine over 40t deep in some areas uh between between the two wash outs the company estimates over 10,000 acre feet of water was lost uh you can see these images uh how extreme the erosion was uh there's a actually that red circle is a side by side so it's about six feet tall to give you a sense as to how deep that Ravine actually is structure window the repairs uh since the wash out happened s since uh there's a narrow construction window uh there's a narrow uh oh sorry since there's a narrow construction window because of the high elevations uh the company acted quickly and had to repair the design uh have a repair designed and have a uh selected contractor the construction began in August and concluded in late October uh the company has been able to temporarily cover the cost using their 2023 budget as well as emergency reserves uh they're requesting a loan to ultimately cover the cost of the project ials uh the project cost is approximately $1.43 million with the service fee the total loan comes to$ 1, 414,000 and as I mentioned before their terms would be 2.1% uh for 30-year term uh the financial ratios indicate the company is an overall average borrower and collateral will consist uh revenues backed by assessment Covenant and the project itself per policy 5 recation as you saw the beginning of your memo and I think Brandon Johnson may be on yes he is okay great to say word or two okay Mr Johnson would you like to add anything yeah Joshua covered pretty much everything that we had I just want to reiterate it was a Act of God that this happened to us and we we took every measure and put every resource we had while still operating during the year to complete this project and now we're faed with uh zero money to finish out the year until our annual meeting to start the new budget so we've had uh several loans with you in the past I think we do have an existing one now that's down to maybe 800,000 or something that we pay annually um but this would help us out uh beneficially I do not think we'll need the full 1.4 but it will be close and then if board has any questions on what we done we got the like Joshua said we got on it real fast and got it all done because with short window in case it snows so that we could get this completed for the new water year questions questions for Brandon or for Joshua director sakata thank you Mr chair thanks for joining us Mr Johnson um and looking on some of the some middles that look like you're going to have to increase your assessments by quite a bit is that correct is everybody going to be able to handle that yes we did have a shareholder meeting prior to and they did vote to go ahead and fix it and borrow the money and uh we will raise assessments to whatever whatever the cost is to pay back well that's great well thank you very much regarding the staff recommendation I move to approve stack staff recommendation for 16b second director Vasquez at the second okay any other discussion okay all those in favor say I I oppos motion carries all right thank you all yeah thank you Brandon yep uh item 16c project loan requests for the Fruit Growers Reservoir Gates replacement for the Orchard City Irrigation District in Delta County has been owned by The Bureau recommendation since 1937 with the dam uh when the dam failed and flooded the downstream town of Austin however the Orchard City Irrigation District operates and maintains the reservoir in dam for the benefit of the 558 qualified land owners that receive water from the district flow from the reservoir is manually manually controlled by its Gates which are in need of replacement the loan amount for the gate replacement is $55,000 and the terms are 30 years at a 2.2 Blended interest rate my contact in preparing the board memo has been Mitch Thomas the acting president the district as well as Susie bilbury and Delta conservation district manager uh the district is still using the same Gates that the bo had installed uh back in the 1930s uh the gates are still manually operated and emergency and the emergency gate leaks uh at, 1500 gallons per minute even when fully closed uh replacing these two gates will minimize the risk of significant failure and will allow for more accurate flow regulation and measurement with the with the installation of the electric controls uh furthermore this project will allow for future development of a skada system to enable Telemetry and remote control control of releases from the reservoir uh the engineering design was completed the past summer and a contractor was selected in September uh the reservoir was drained by the time of my site visit as you can see here um in preparation for construction between the 2023 and 2024 uh irrigation Seasons uh the project cost is estimated $1.13 million uh with the service feed the district is only asking for $55,000 uh the rest will be funded by already approved wsf grants as well as a grant from the CL River Water Conservation District uh as I mentioned before their interest rate is 2.2% for 30-year term uh the financial ratios indicate that they are strong borrower and a collateral is a pledge of revenues backed by assessment Covenant recommendation as you see at the front of your board memo I'd be happy to answer any questions also I believe sus bilbury maybe on line to say a few words as well or someone else from the district yes I'm on the line This is C wanted to add well I would like to thank Matt Sterns and Joshua both for working with us on this this has been a really uh tough project to do and we're very excited to get it rolling and um get this those Gates replaced with such a a long running Reservoir has there been a change in the total storage capacity over time due to siltation uh I know for a fact there has been a lot of silt um and I think they've had issues dealing with the bo to actually remove that dredge but I think maybe Susie can speak better to that than I can no that is correct yeah to dredge it um would be extremely expensive and would' have to go through a lot of Permitting and as it stands it's doing okay we're holding the water we need to hold at the moment and it might need to be dredged in the next five or 10 years possibly but right now with the flow through that we get it's doing okay and just for FYI we do of course fill it during winter months but uh the quality of the audio was poor enough I don't think we could quite understand you so uh perhaps you could just provide the information to cwcb and he could send an email to us to answer the question I could absolutely follow up with that yeah okay okay I'm sorry about that yeah sorry director comes so this was this dam was built by The Bureau that's correct after the uh the original dam was uh breached and flooded the downstream um town of Austin the bureau came in and took over both ownership well ownership of the dam and the reservoir and the previous organization that the district came out of kind of folded or recreated itself into an Irrigation District and now is responsible for operation of Maintenance but yes the bureau did come in and build the uh the dam back so they built the dam after the original breach okay so so then so Orchard City didn't purchase o andm from the bureau it was always the AR that's my understanding as well yes thank you hey are there any other questions director Anderson did you want to make this motion Mr chair I would move to approve staff recommendation on agenda item 16c okay and second by director comes oh sorry just yeah throw something at me I think we have some support from the southwest as well uh all those in favor of the motion say I all post okay the motion carries thank you Joshua thank you all very much thank you Susie yeah thanks Susie okay item 17 2024 projects Bill why ADV Kirk Russell the finance section chief so we will be going over the 2024 projects Bill and to kind of lay out for those that are listening and that have not been part of our process at cwcb how we um applications and review by this board and then or by the finance committee and ultimately by this board on the screen I'm showing that process for applying for non-reimbursable project Investments which which for us internally means it's not a loan and it requires legislative action for us to give it to somebody whether it be for a grant or to spend it for a project purpose or program and so the process we go through we have an application date in a August each year in September those applications have been reviewed by staff and then presented to the finance committee which is traditionally the day or two before the board meets at its regularly scheduled September meeting with recommendations for approval or denial or modification then at the November board meeting meeting annually we present these to the board some of which are put in a block and so agenda item 17A is a block of items that the committee gave the nod to that enough information was presented to just keep them Consolidated and did not require a full presentation to the to the full board and the public and then there's another batch of items that are under uh Item B that were asked the board or the commit ask staff to provide a little bit more probably need a little bit of exposure to the public for uh for their benefit and maybe even the board's benefit um to polish some things between finance committee and the board meeting so then whatever uh non-reimbursable items are approved by this board they are included in a request to the project sponsors in uh I'm sorry I missed a step so between November and January there might be some slight modifications to some things that this board has requested and maybe there's um a result of something we're doing that requires maybe a statute change or some tweaks here and there uh we catch between November and January we will come back in January with the list of all these as just one more one more review before we ultimately present them to the sponsors of the projects bill which alternates each year and I believe we are in the uh house a committee in the 2024 session about non-reimbursable project Investments we focus on a policy that uh requires us to grow the construction fund and Perpetual based fund at a rate that uh provides a buying power for the fund for future each year and so the number that we utilize and it stays pretty consistent at about three and a half to 4% each year you would think with the in increase in cost of construction right now that we're seeing across the board that would have a huge impact um when we use the average that we use the 20year average it stays pretty consistent we use um an indic out of an engineering document each each year and we measure that and then see what the 20-year average is and so it holds true to about that 3.6 3.9 I think was a couple years ago could show more next year and you can see that line we try to uh get those two funds the blue is the construction fund and the red is Severance tax Perpetual base fund and we try to keep that stay on that line uh into the future years and so whatever is above that line in projections that is available for non-reimbursable project Investments and and I said as I said in agenda item 15 our Target is about 20 million each year now and that's because uh prop DD has taken care of the water plan grants we've got some consistency uh annually in the the wsrf program and things are just seem fairly stable and that is that is allowing us uh to bring to this board about 20 to $25 million every year for non-reimbursable investment applications so I'm going to move on to let see what no I got to stay here sorry on the slide I'm showing the the actual numbers that create what remains available and so we look we focus on the new money that comes in and that's Interest Federal mineral lease and Severance tax and I use a 10-year average for that last year and I I show that as a spill over a 23 million I think that was a 26 million number if I I may have that number incorrect but I I believe that spill over was 26 million which gave us a total of about $66 million in uh the sever tax revenue that we get it actually exceeded 50 million last year but anything in excess of 50 the next 10 million go to to cdph and then we get everything above that so um it came in somewhere I think around uh 59 million so if I take the 50 plus the 26 that's the number that I'm showing on this giving us $110 million of new money then I go through and extract what it's taking to operate do the statutory requirements that we have they're required we don't have to go to the projects Bill they're automatic and director sakata this is where I thought I had that listing but that um gauge funds is located in statute Auto refresh and so that's part of that 6.7 million our the statute has items in it that cwcb pays for it's a total of about 2.7 million and that 2.7 they're all refreshes so if we didn't spend any money at all we would have a zero impact but I've got to prepare for the worst case scenario so that kind of puts it into that that fluctuation area so I plan on that 6.7 number includes 2.7 for statutory items we have a requirement to fund uh emergency a drought grants if there's a declaration for Drought by the governor that's a million dollars and then the wsrf will be the item we talking a little bit on item 18 that's the transfer of Perpetual base money over to wsr f for our annual um the board's opportunity to fund that annually at $3 million so that's where that 6.7 comes from then you can see my growth number um actually I've got 3.9 there don't I I think that other that other uh line I had I in correct number that should have been 3.9 million that's the consistent number I have year in and year out total of 55 I take the math subtract that out the caveat in this particular presentation is is showing that $26 million transfer uh from the sever tax Perpetual baseed to the general fund and so I've balanced that out which leaves me about $29 million available for non-reimbursable Investments okay thanks Mr chair thanks Kurt so this the gauge fund that I read about in the statute it's just for cwcb purposes that's not going to DNR to help them at all I believe that that's correct I think Rob ve manages that so that's like for your instream flow when you have to put in some ages to determine that okay thanks well and that's why I asked that question because thinking about some of the other requests that you're having I was wondering if they were getting any those funds and they're not thank you that is y we manage that money thank you into the end block portion of this and my my proposal will be to keep all these together unless the board wants to pull one out for any particular reason and I could have staff uh come up and talk about it I believe you've heard the details at the finance committee to to make an action but to run through the list the uh the risk the flood plane risk management that is a routine funded effort it's $500,000 and you can see in the table the activity that Kevin Hal's group has been using that funds for we've done that for many years about that um that dollar amount the litigation fund is the um uh the Attorney General office presents in May their budget and that is reflected here on how much we need to refresh that uh next year and so that Cycles through we've we've targeted that we'll refresh that up to two million as needed but the the budget impact is is 30,000 less than that it's starting to creep up into that uh $2 million number but you can see the list of things that were proposed out of their budget in the litigation fund that one is a refresh so if they don't spend it we just push it back up to 2 million and it's available for the next fiscal year weather modification permitting program that is the uh the effort to for cloud seating around the state mezzet enhancements I was fortunate enough to go visit a uh a climate site a mezzet site it's actually a very interesting um thing to take a look at and it might be something this board would be interested in if we ever met in a location near that there's a lot of lot of Technology goes into those things uh those large towers and the way they measure things they certainly worry that they are an attractive nuisance for somebody with something they shouldn't be using there um yeah they just seem very vulnerable to to troublemakers like high school boys like I had um let's see that's 200,000 I wanted to point out that normally that is an ask for 150,000 that is an increase to 200,000 because of some cost increases that the uh the mezzet folks are experiencing so we had an opportunity to get that up to 200,000 this year satellite monitoring again routine business $380,000 and that does go to uh dwr for their efforts on the satellite monitoring systems to update their uh their equipment for maintenance as well the ucrc modeling efforts um I underlined here it is critical that the ucrc support the upper Basin in technical modeling and Analysis to ensure that the post 2026 negotiations efforts uh negotiations develop operating guidelines that align with actual hydrology and so that uh certainly a very important effort for staff as well last item is the water forecasting partnership uh project that you hear Eric Sky talk routinely to the board about related primarily related to the uh Airborne snow measurement efforts so that's $2 million this year in ask so with that I will entertain questions or action to approve all those in one block okay thank you Mr chair just a recommendation um Kirk on the title document that you have and is to add a column of how many dollars this is bringing in um because you know on each of the data sheets we see that like for the flood risk how much federal dollars U that's actually bringing in for the Mesonet project how much other federal dollars that's bringing in so I think it's great for people to understand that this is this investment of $6 million how many dollars is actually bringing into the state that's a good point you mean when you consolidate all of it to say yeah when we and and we do focus in this board I know appreciates that we do like to focus on money that does leverage other money whether it's private or federal money I think that's a win for the state of Colorado anytime we can do that so no I appreciate that director sakata that' probably be a good a good statement to be touting this work thank you makes it more of an investment than an expenditure unfair question for you that I'm going to ask but maybe it can be answered by others in cwcb later and it's the weather mod program and uh always the question what do we get for the money that's spent in terms of increase precipitation I don't and it's very difficult to quantify I know that um I there is probably much more uh knowled better knowledge than mine but I I do remember a study that was done that has been touted by Andrew Rickert who manages that that money but I was thinking that it was like five to eight% increase when it was utilized and I think I I think that sorry um I think that um number came from a Wyoming study didn't it I believe that's cor right uh so we've seen that in the North Plat Basin because the North Plat was the first to do the aerial seating uh in collaboration with Wyoming but I've always wondered you know what is the real benefit um in wet water uh when we spend this money to seed clouds I know again uh that money is leveraged with lower basin States and and private entities as well I know that one's got a lot of Leverage money as well sorry director I was going to say it's not just this cloud seating it's also for the snowmaking and for a lot of things that happen along in that program there's other things folded into it so it's not just what extra yield you can get out of the clouds there's a whole lot into that hole that it's hard to quantify agree but I think it's still worth looking at so and and it leverages a ton of money we get a lot of other federal funds to come in to help when we go down one of those Avenues Dr sakata thank you Mr chair yeah I think I saw the data sheet said 1.5 matching from the lower Basin States for this program and but I think this also makes an argument for our Arial snow observation that you know with that kind of detail maybe we can get some of the results what you're talking about really seeing what what that what that's yielding so that if there's no other comments I'd make the motion okay director Cloud I was gonna ask if we car to cared to participate on that so we have a motion in a second are there any any further discussion all those in favor say I I and opposed okay motion carries thank you and I know uh I know Andrew he waits patiently to be able to jump on and and answer questions he's going to be disappointed he was not on this because he loves to talk uh about his weather mod program takes great pride in that 17b and uh chairman felt I I I'm going to offer up this idea that um these each one of these projects kind of has they can stand on their own and uh we do have a an opportunity to do a recommendation to approve them when they're presented you certainly could lump them together or or make uh the motion at the end individually we do have enough funds to cover them all so it really comes back to whether the the board is comfortable funding them at the level that they are being requested or recommend recommended for funding but I just wanted to offer that flexibility to kind of turn it into more of an individual item as presented and then uh the board can act after that item is presented yeah I I would say let's take them one at a time then with that and I will uh I'll turn the the microphone over to the speakers and then you can move through them as uh as the items come come up and then I'll jump back up here actually Anna Moss will be doing agenda item 17c and then I'll be back up for 18 so with that I will turn it over to cat uh Weiss Miller and Russ Sans right Thank you Kirk M cwcv staff for the record um I was going to say Where's that c the board with a request that was supported by the finance committee in September for a drought resilience investment from the state's non-reimbursable fund total of 4 million to address an assortment of water plan actions that all support drought resilience the drought resilience investment would support the following water plan actions drought resilience workshops which are an effort that Builds on mapping the board previously funded uh that devel and would develop and provide local workshops to identify local values at risk and Pathways to mitigate drought that would roll up to Regional water security road maps um as noted in action F 4.10 the water plan Outreach Campaign which is action 4.3 that's an effort to strategically fund a broader water plan Outreach messaging campaign and promote state and local water education water loss prevention and validator training which is actually 1.3 that's an effort to fund a third phase of the Colorado water loss initiative that focuses on water loss audit training and third party validation um adaptive and critical drought projects that's supports a number of different water plan actions and that's an effort to identify write and photograph design and print a two-year sort of Ripple effects style document that marks progress on the water plan two years on and we'll um kind of touch on agency actions but also look at some of the partner actions and really feature people in projects which is something we kind of heard was missing from the most recent water plan that was featured in the the first water plan uh the next item would be a storage analysis opportunities and um Alternatives report and that would help evaluate what types of storage exists evaluate alternatives to storage it would include groundwater and surface water uh highlight opportunities to explore a range of storage options and and flexibility and it also Builds on numbers from the 2019 Tech update and the last item would be a water conservation handbook and that's action 1.1 and that will help to Define water savings communities which were written into the first water plan and then uh expanded upon in the 2023 water plan and it'll explore a possible range of water conservation targets and savings reuse potential water less reductions and more um kind of based on community type and character so those are the drought resilience actions that we're looking to fund through this request would round out funding from last year's NRI request and we fund all four actions in the water plan or action areas of the water plan and really set us on a trajectory for 50 c 50% completion of water plan actions by the fiveyear anniversary of its release and this is a really important Milestone to keep us on track to complete the water plans agency actions within the next 10 years this funding is um not going to provide total funding for the water plan actions and we will have to come back to the board at a later date for funding requests for the next tech update the Basin implementation plans on the water Plan update down the road but this funding would be critical to give cwcb staff the means to make critical Investments that support both local initiatives and state initiatives um just to note that none of the actions in the water plan are actually funded so we do have to come to you for these requests to fund the water plan so with that um we recommend that uh the board approves this NRI request to support drought resilience funding uh for the water plan okay are there questions for cat thank you Mr chair and uh sorry okay um cat thanks for the presentation just wanted to ask a question about how this proposal fits in with the Colorado drought advisor project that both CDA and cwcb have funded led by Rocky Mountain Farmers Union that's working directly with farmers and ranchers on drought planning and they have a toolkit and and and a training program out there can you just speak to that relationship sure um first of all that's a great program um they're doing amazing work um I think that the way that this engages with that program that's water plan Grant funded um so I think for example um if we go back to these are Kirk slides um I'm all over the place now but if we go back to the next one before that all right um the Adaptive and critical drought projects that's where we would be highlighting partner action so that would be where a place where we could really highlight what Colorado drought advisers is doing um and engage with that work and really showcase all the good stuff happening on the ground there Pat and Russ I mean I'm happy to support this funding request but I guess my question for you to think about you don't need to answer today is given the uncertain um funding future that we Face uh and given what you mentioned about other needs to support the water plan um actions completion um that are not going to be funded with this request I just I want to encourage you to think about whether we should ask for more now uh so that that money is available to make sure that we can complete the important work laid out in the water plan thank you other questions or comments director sakata thank you Mr chair thanks cat thanks Russ uh you guys do amazing work so it's really amazing on the a couple things to think about is on the water plan Outreach campaign um I think there's a young lady that's willing to be a water Ambassador remember her her comment from the plan so you might want to reach out to her I'm sure she'd be excited to participate and I think she could get the word out quite a bit um and then also I know the um the report that you what was it called the report water oh the Adaptive and critical drought projects that would be the the two-year kind so I know I realize that's a report but it just got me to thinking about this how we communicate the message because I always struggle with that too we get so many great projects how do I identify them and get them out there so people can take advant AG of that and we struggled with that in agriculture and so I don't think it could be a part of this but an idea that I was thinking about was whether to be able to fund those people that did the project that farmer Rancher to get them to go make presentations um because sometimes we'll listen to a farmer more than we will somebody else you know so it's something to think about it's not included in this not at all but again an idea and maybe even Kawa maybe I can talk about Kawa to see if they'd be interested in supporting something like that so thanks that's a great idea questions comments um we are going to vote on these one at a time Craig one at a time yep I would move staff approval of I move approval of Staff recommendation on agenda item 17 B1 okay second director Cloud further discussion all those in favor say I I I opposed carries thank you thank you Cat by diversion Telemetry project my name is Jason Olman I am the deputy State engineer with the Division of Water Resources here about diversion Telemetry uh one of the programs that is in perview is our hydrography program which is the stream measuring staff that we have that keep our gauges up and running throughout the state both on diversions and on streams um before I talk about our exact request I would be remiss to not thank the board and staff for your support for operation and maintenance in the previous item uh you've been consistently supporting our satellite monitoring program for years and it's a huge deal for us in administering water throughout the State and then also thank you for previous approvals of Roundtable grants for some similar ideas to this that were from division one uh that Brent shant spearheaded in division one and a recent request from Divi in division six on the AA white green round table for the be River for about 20 gauges um these things um maybe not peac meal but through different round taes and they've been very successful I don't know if you've heard the division one was one of the more successful Round Table grants uh people have really um it's been successful because people the transparency that it provides for folks this additional measuring the efficiency that it provides our office to administer water and so um we had another number of Divisions looking to do similar things in their divisions on diversion structures and we spoke to staff about maybe the best way to do a Statewide project and this is what we've come up with is this request funds for is enough funds to do approximately 306 sites in divisions one all divisions except for division six not because we don't care about division six but division six recently got that in the round table for what they felt were their priority needs we went to all the division engineers and their staff and asked them to put together a wish list for what they would need to more efficiently administer water in their divisions and division six felt like they had covered theirs but that's how we came up with the list of gauges that are included in this request um primarily they're installed on diversions there's some Reservoir gauging in there as well for stages and there's a few stream gauges that are in included but they're mainly to manage diversions from the river the total request is 1.8 million uh 1.82 7 million dwr will be performing all the installation uh which results in about $326,000 of in kind work um unfortunately the table's not fully visible but this is a breakdown of where those gauges are included uh so you'll see that divis 1 through four have close to $400,000 worth of gauge infrastructure and then a little bit less in the remaining divisions like I said this was list was put together by staff on what we felt was necessary to help help with Administration help owners with their management you'll notice that on some of the divisions you see that in division one for instance 63 sites um for 42,000 whereas in division um two you see 30 sites for 409,000 question you might have is why the same price for half the gauges some of those in division one are just data collectors so they're not including satellite Telemetry there it's just the the need there is just for a continuous recorder not for the satellite Telemetry as you might imagine the antennas and solar panels and the equipment needed to communicate with the satellite it's fairly EXP expensive so the components of this that it was present in the division one round table grants for these same uh projects and the division six is a requirement that the owners of these structures have some Financial input to the project because one they're going to own the equipment so they have to pay for the replacement at the end of life of this equipment and two it costs us times time and money to maintain the infrastructure right so we're asking the $300 annual fee that they pay to dwr the annual fee uh is basically to do help us with the work that we do to keep it on the go Network most of these will primarily be on the satellite network instead of cellular Telemetry because in a lot of these divisions these are on upper tributaries that don't have good sell infrastructure there might be a few that would be on sale if it's available but primarily on the go Network one of the really great things in the division 6 grant that we'd like to replicate around the state was aggregating the fees so this $300 fee for small ditch companies that feel like that's too much to pay or that it may be hard to convince them that this is a benefit to them um the upper Yampa water concy district committed to paying five years of those fees in division six and so as we go around the state and talk to the users and the Conservancy districts and water you know Mutual ditch companies we're going to try to see if that can be replicated it also helps our staff in not having to Bill 306 additional Fe people instead we could build maybe you know 10 a tenth of that of measurement and measurement's a topic that I heard come up many times yesterday at the C9 Summit it's you know the the fact that we need more measurement to do a better job managing our water as we have scarcer resources it improves our accuracy of administration if our commissioners can see what's out there what's being taken on the ground it's transparent now as many of you know you've been involved in water the transparency sometimes is because you want to see what your neighbors are taking you probably know what you're taking in your own ditch but it's nice to see what your neighbors are taking you feel like you can trust that the division's doing their job it enables more efficient operation ations so for those users that can access their data remotely or can get continuous record of what they've been using it can help them improve their operations it also increases our efficiency uh as a state agency because our water Commissioners in the places where we don't have Telemetry are running up and down streams sometimes they've got to go check the gauge at the top of the stream to see what's available then they check what everybody's taking then they got to go back out and adjust each of those headgates to get you know to make sure that only the people that are entitled to take water at that time are doing so so it really helps with the efficiency of our Administration as well you know some of you have already seen this from the finance committee meeting but this is just a diagram of how the go system works I don't know that we need to go into too much detail about the satellite system um but the next picture is one I did want to highlight so over the years we've um our gauging system and the infrastructure that we need to make this happen has gotten better and better or smaller and smaller maybe I should say so you see the green uh CMP gauge house there that's a stealing well you'll see those around the state on streams where we have a pipe that allows us to measure the level in the Stream we've moved a lot of these to Canal levers with Radars on the end which is that picture on the left there's a fairly heavy radar with that cone on the bottom that measures the water level but since that time in just the last few years that little canned shaped structure there is a Vega radar it's a new it's the new Radars that we're using and what we'd like to do with a lot of these diversion record uh diversion structure gauges is do a very simple you know implementation and not have such a huge structure out there so you you'll see this is a structure in division 3 or in the Rio Grand where we just used three strut pieces of strut and mounted that radar directly to that and then they used the existing gauge house to mount the electronics in many of them we would just be using a Nema box mounted on a 2 by on a 4x6 or something similar so not a huge impact to these structures either just EX examples of how our website has evolved all of these sites that have Telemetry on them now I said there some will be just be data collectors would be available on our site for people to see at any time um are there any questions about this request any questions on this one director sakata thank you thanks Mr Elman I think uh for my insight on division one I think part of the reason it was so successful is because Brent shs went out at to install these because he was doing it on his own time it was like he was so busy I just give him so much credit for you know wanting to Institute this and go out on his own to put these in yeah it was thanks to all his hard work really yeah we owe a lot to all of his work I think he also managed it out of his garage but maybe I won't say that out loud I'll did um and one of the things that we've received with the Colorado River positions that have been talked about in other areas is we've gotten four additional hydrographers in the west slope divisions we hope to be able to use them a little bit cross division to help install these structures so that we are getting some additional Staffing because that's one question we've had is you're going to add all these gauges across the state how are you going to manage them so or a motion on the staff recommendation Cloud on the second right all those in favor say I I oppose motion carries thank you very much thank you okay Southern High Plains groundwater study Tracy Koff Deputy State engineer I'd like to ask for your support today for a $250,000 request this is a project that's both a study update for the Southern High Plains groundwater resources uh and also Community facilitation effort for the local community in the Southern High Plains if you're not familiar this is a part of Colorado in the very Southeastern Corner mostly in AK County that's basically entirely reliant on groundwater and their groundwater resources are managed by the Colorado groundwater commission little different from a lot of the studies that You' fund because of this community facilitation effort we think that it' be really important for the community to be made aware of their resources and consider various scenarios for managing those resources going into the future some scenario analysis and also some analysis of the economic impacts to the community of doing different types of management changes for their groundwater resources and we'd really like to see the community be able to come together with a common understanding of what they have what the future outlook is is for the groundwater resources for its use and if they could come together to be able to speak with one voice about what they'd like to see and bring that back to the groundwater commission if they want to see changes to the rules that regulate groundwater permitting in the area we've had several years where there's been differences of opinion from the local community raised at the groundwater commission and so it's been pretty tough for the commission to really know what to do to best support this community so uh with that I I do have a local representative on the zoom Blake gorley he's a member of the local Southern High Plains groundwater Management District just to talk to you about why this project might be important hi yes thank you Tracy yes can you hear me yes we sure can go ahead Blake perfect well thank you Tracy uh first off yes I'm Blake gorley I'm the chairman of the Southern High Plains groundwater Management District uh I'd like to start off by thanking you all for your consideration on fun funding a groundwater study in the Southern High Plain designated Basin uh there's recently been some discussion about the large capacity Appropriations within the Basin uh the commission has been asked to make a determination on the future of the Appropriations within the Basin and as a district we feel like the commission should have uh the most upto-date and accurate information before they made such an important decision uh the previous study we have although it was very comprehensive the McLaughlin study um is it's now over 20 years old and has very limited information on the dockham water bearing formation uh we believe that the information we could gather from a new study would give us the greatest opportunity to make a proper decision for the future of the Basin with that that's really all I had but I I really appreciate the whole District we really appreciate you all uh considering us for this uh this funding we think it'd be really important for us and and as Tracy said our our economic future is is dependent almost exclusively on groundwater so so we really appreciate you and all that you're doing for us here thank you Mr chair yeah Blake I just wanted to make a comment thanks the for the community being willing to step up I know it's believe you me familiar with groundwater and everything it's uh it can be challenging and scary but if if you don't know what's there you don't know how to manage it so I appreciate the efforts of the community and wish you luck and with that I would move approval of Staff recommendation okay motion to approve second from director Vasquez R we have a lot of support Here Blake uh all those in favor of the motion say I and opposed motion carries thank you Tracy thank you thank you all very much thank you all right and uh the turf replacement funding good afternoon Jenna Batson CWC staff for the record uh this is my first time having the privilege to address the board and I regret asking for money my first time out of the gate but here we are so thank you for the opportunity where you thank you uh so to start I just want to provide some background and updates on ccb's Turf replacement program created by hb22 1151 that leveraged $2 million in Statewide Investments to advance transformative landscape change uh and support Municipal outdoor water conservation efforts through turf removal cwcb launched the turf replacement program six months early in January of 20203 to align with the re release of the Colorado water plan as cwcb implemented and managed the turf replacement program which has Pro proliferated the amount of turf removal and replacement efforts across the state generated increased Community interest in water savings and supported the goals of action 1.7 in the Colorado water plan months of launch the available funding from hp22 11151 has been earmarked for allocation to 50 eligible entities with matching funds through two funding Cycles uh to create or advance local Turf rebate programs or Target high water use areas to remove and replace non-functional Turf as you can see from the map Colorado insurance does not geographically isolated around 25 to 30% of funding recipients are expected to be from the Western Slope when Contracting is completed funding source in the amount of $2 million through non-reimbursable project Investments would allow cwcb to continue the turf replacement program to provide Financial support for local turf removal and replacement efforts across Colorado uh the funding would also allow us to extend the position to continue to manage the program as well as support The Proven and growing interest in Turf replacement efforts continue the momentum created by the turf replacement program and help facilitate local water conservation programs so with all of that background in mind staff recommends the board approve $2 million in funding for the turf replacement program for the construction fund for inclusion in the 2024 projects bill thank you so much for your time and consideration and I'm here with my team in case you have any questions okay we have questions for Jenna chairman I would move staff approval approval of Staff recommendation that's twice of agenda item 17 B4 okay we have motion by director Bret in a second by director Cloud are any further discussion okay all those in favor say I and opposed motion carries thank you have item 17 C which is water plan implementation cash fund good afternoon for the record animos cbcb staff and thrilled to be here in a new role and thank you so much to director riss for letting me have this opportunity and a huge um yeah it's just it's an incredible opportunity and I'm incredibly grateful um also super excited to have Cole jump into his new role I think he and I are going to make a great team together so lots of lots of good things happening but this is agenda item 17c this is where we look at the revenue that came in from sports betting and ask for you all to include it for an appropriation in the upcoming projects Bill and just kind of a reminder of how that works it's a little bit of an aars model it's the what we're appropriating requesting appropriation for today is what was collected by the Department of Revenue in fiscal year 2223 then they close out that fiscal year transfer the funds to us in the fall so right around the time of our finance committee those funds got deposited into our fund um and then we can't spend those until we get the spending Authority through an appropriation so that goes into the 2024 projects bill so in September we received a transfer of about 23.8 million um our incredibly talented new budget analyst Sarah looked at the fund also looked at the interest that that fund generates looked at what our staffing costs are we've got the the five our four regional managers and a contract administrator that are supported by that so took out those costs and believe that we have 23.3 million available uh for water plan grants for inclusion in the projects bill so with that I'll happily answer any questions if you have any do I would move staff recommendation for agenda item 17 C is really contributing to the bottom line there so all those in favor of the motion say I I I and opposed motion carries thank you Anna okay last item of the day day theoretically item 18 Severance tax Perpetual base fund transfer to water supply Reserve fund than you chairman felt Kirk Russell Finance Section Chief and one more item before we get to celebrate Kevin Ryan's retirement um Kevin it's been wonderful to work with you over the years you've uh yeah our entire staff is very appreciative of all the just all the work that we get to do together so you're we're going to miss you but congratulations it's awesome so uh agenda item 18 is a routine item that the uh the way the statute or the law was Rewritten Senate Bill 21281 gave the board the opport or the the use of severance tax Perpetual based fund money to fund water supply Reserve fund projects and so that is it's not going to go in the projects bill because that money is continuously appropriated by by Statute but it gives this board the opportunity to fund it at the level that they choose to so throughout my calculations for the projects Bill non-reimbursable stuff this has to be included as an impact to that growth calculation and so you've heard me talk about this $3 million transfer I I actually I haven't run this by director riss but it this seems to be something we could probably put in a consent agenda item because it will be fairly routine unless something disastrous happens on the money side but I do foresee this to be a pretty routine um item I want to point out that you heard me talk about this item back in may we forgot to do it last November when we should have done it so it's seems like we just did this and that's correct this money will be uh transferred right after July 1st of 2024 and so this it lines up well with the the November board meeting to uh to make this ask and so with that I would uh take any questions and offer the staff recommendation okay questions ber I don't know if I had that on a slide I might not have it'd be on the top of the uh the memo okay unless you want me to read it thank you Mr chair I recommend we approve item 18 on Seance tax okay um thank you I just might remind the board that this was actually a a plan for investing in wsrf that you all discussed and approved I don't know what like a year or so ago um that this would just be an ongoing investment of three million every year so we've talked about this before and this is the plan that we all sort of agreed to follow for wsrf and the and the intention behind that was really to sort of even out the distribution to wsrf so the roundt knew what to expect um it's actually more funding than was historically available on an annual basis so it takes the volatility of the fluctuation sance tax and just makes a little bit more I don't know easier to plan for thank you director rissy I probably should have mentioned that in addition we set aside $9 million as a reserve for this just in case we do go through a couple years of um difficult financial times that we can just draw down on that Reserve so we still leave that in place and we continue to put 3 million in when we do have it available in a second any further discussion okay all those in favor say I I opposed motion carries the end of our agenda today is there anything elsea um just to confirm a couple things breakfast is available here tomorrow 7:30 starting at 8:30 at the meeting and then is there any direction on sort of where we're gathering for Kevin or"
